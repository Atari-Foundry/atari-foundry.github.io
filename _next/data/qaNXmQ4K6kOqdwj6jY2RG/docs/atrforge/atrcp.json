atrcp - Copy Files to and from ATR Images\n\n`atrcp` is the file courier of the atrforge toolkit. It copies individual files between ATR images and your host filesystem. Think of it as `cp`, but for files inside disk images. It's actually quite handy when you just need to update one file without recreating the entire disk.\n\n## Overview\n\natrcp is the newest addition to the toolkit (well, relatively speaking). It's designed for quick file operations - when you just need to copy one file in or out of an ATR image without the overhead of extracting everything or recreating the image.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Extracts individual files from ATR images\n- Adds individual files to ATR images\n- Converts between UTF8 and ATASCII on the fly\n- Creates automatic backups when modifying ATR files\n\n**What it doesn't do:**\n- List directory contents (that's `lsatr`'s job)\n- Create new images (that's `atrforge`'s job)\n- Convert entire images (that's `convertatr`'s job)\n- Make your files faster (we're not that good)\n\n## Command Syntax\n\n```bash\natrcp [options] <source> <destination>\n```\n\nThe source and destination can be either regular files or files inside ATR images (using the special `image.atr:path` syntax).\n\n## ATR Path Format\n\nFiles inside ATR images are specified using a colon separator:\n\n```\nimage.atr:path/to/file.ext\n```\n\nThe format is: `image_file:path_inside_image`\n\nExamples:\n- `disk.atr:MYFILE.COM` - File in root directory\n- `disk.atr:GAMES/GAME1.COM` - File in subdirectory\n- `disk.atr:` - Just the image (for adding files, uses source filename)\n\nIf you omit the path after the colon when adding a file, it uses the source filename. Convenient!\n\n## Options\n\n### `--to-utf8` - Convert ATASCII to UTF8\n\nConverts the file from ATASCII to UTF8 when extracting from an ATR. This is useful if you want to edit the file in a modern UTF8 editor.\n\n```bash\natrcp --to-utf8 disk.atr:SOURCE.BAS source.bas\n```\n\nThe conversion happens during extraction, so you get a UTF8 file ready for editing.\n\n### `--to-atascii` - Convert UTF8 to ATASCII\n\nConverts the file from UTF8 to ATASCII when adding to an ATR. This is useful if you've edited a file in UTF8 and need it back in ATASCII format.\n\n```bash\natrcp --to-atascii source.bas disk.atr:SOURCE.BAS\n```\n\nThe conversion happens during the add operation, so your UTF8 file becomes ATASCII in the image.\n\n### `--7bit` - 7-bit Mode\n\nUses 7-bit mode for ATASCII→UTF8 conversion. This strips the high bit from characters, effectively converting to 7-bit ASCII.\n\n```bash\natrcp --7bit --to-utf8 disk.atr:FILE.TXT file.txt\n```\n\nUseful when you want pure 7-bit ASCII without the high-bit characters that ATASCII uses.\n\n**Note:** This only affects ATASCII→UTF8 conversion. It doesn't do anything for UTF8→ATASCII.\n\n### `-h` - Help\n\nShows a brief help message. You're reading the extended version.\n\n### `-v` - Version\n\nShows version information. Version numbers matter.\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\n### Extract from ATR\n\nExtract a file from an ATR image to the host filesystem:\n\n```bash\natrcp disk.atr:MYFILE.COM myfile.com\n```\n\nOr to the current directory using the same name:\n\n```bash\natrcp disk.atr:MYFILE.COM .\n```\n\n### Add to ATR\n\nAdd a file from the host filesystem to an ATR image:\n\n```bash\natrcp myfile.com disk.atr:MYFILE.COM\n```\n\nOr let it use the source filename:\n\n```bash\natrcp myfile.com disk.atr:\n```\n\nThis adds `myfile.com` to the root of the disk with the same name.\n\n### Add to Subdirectory\n\nAdd a file to a subdirectory in the ATR:\n\n```bash\natrcp myfile.com disk.atr:GAMES/MYFILE.COM\n```\n\nThe directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist. How helpful!\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Extract\n\nExtract a file from an ATR:\n\n```bash\natrcp disk.atr:PROGRAM.COM program.com\n```\n\n### Basic Add\n\nAdd a file to an ATR:\n\n```bash\natrcp program.com disk.atr:PROGRAM.COM\n```\n\n### Extract with UTF8 Conversion\n\nExtract and convert to UTF8:\n\n```bash\natrcp --to-utf8 disk.atr:SOURCE.BAS source.bas\n```\n\n### Add with ATASCII Conversion\n\nAdd and convert to ATASCII:\n\n```bash\natrcp --to-atascii source.bas disk.atr:SOURCE.BAS\n```\n\n### Extract with 7-bit Mode\n\nExtract and convert to UTF8 using 7-bit mode:\n\n```bash\natrcp --7bit --to-utf8 disk.atr:FILE.TXT file.txt\n```\n\n### Add to Subdirectory\n\nAdd a file to a subdirectory:\n\n```bash\natrcp game.com disk.atr:GAMES/GAME.COM\n```\n\n### Use Source Filename\n\nAdd a file using its original name:\n\n```bash\natrcp myfile.com disk.atr:\n```\n\nThis adds `myfile.com` to the root directory of the disk.\n\n### Update Existing File\n\nUpdate an existing file in the ATR:\n\n```bash\natrcp updated.com disk.atr:OLD.COM\n```\n\nThis replaces `OLD.COM` with the contents of `updated.com`. A backup is created automatically (see below).\n\n## Automatic Backups\n\nWhen atrcp modifies an ATR image (by adding or updating files), it automatically creates a backup of the original image. The backup has a `.bak` extension:\n\n- Original: `disk.atr`\n- Backup: `disk.atr.bak`\n\nThis way, if something goes wrong, you can restore the original. We're looking out for you.\n\n**Note:** The backup is created before any modifications, so your original is safe.\n\n## UTF8/ATASCII Conversion\n\natrcp can convert files between UTF8 and ATASCII during copy operations. This is useful when:\n\n- You want to edit files in a modern UTF8 editor\n- You've edited files in UTF8 and need them back in ATASCII\n- You're working with text files that need conversion\n\nSee [UTF8 Conversion](UTF8_CONVERSION.md) for more details on how the conversion works.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n1. **Use `:` for same-name adds** - When adding a file, you can use `disk.atr:` to use the source filename automatically.\n\n2. **Backups are automatic** - Don't worry about backing up - atrcp does it for you.\n\n3. **Directories are created automatically** - If you specify a path that doesn't exist, it's created for you.\n\n4. **Conversion is on-the-fly** - UTF8/ATASCII conversion happens during the copy, so you don't need a separate step.\n\n5. **7-bit mode for compatibility** - Use `--7bit` if you need pure 7-bit ASCII without high-bit characters.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- **Wrong path format** - Remember the colon: `image.atr:path`, not `image.atr/path`.\n\n- **Forgetting the path** - When adding, you need to specify where the file goes. Use `:` if you want the same name.\n\n- **Using both convert options** - You can't convert to UTF8 and ATASCII at the same time. Pick one direction.\n\n- **Expecting `--7bit` to work both ways** - `--7bit` only affects ATASCII→UTF8 conversion, not the reverse.\n\n## Limitations\n\n1. **SpartaDOS/BW-DOS only** - atrcp only works with SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format images (the format that `atrforge` creates).\n\n2. **Single file operations** - You can only copy one file at a time. For multiple files, use `atrforge -a` or extract everything with `lsatr`.\n\n3. **No directory copying** - You can't copy entire directories at once. Copy files individually or use other tools.\n\n4. **File conversion is per-file** - Each file conversion is independent. You can't convert some files and not others in one operation.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) - More usage examples\n- [UTF8 Conversion](UTF8_CONVERSION.md) - Details on UTF8/ATASCII conversion\n- [atrforge](ATRFORGE.md) - For creating images and adding multiple files\n- [lsatr](LSATR.md) - For listing and extracting multiple files\n\n---\n\n*For the complete tool list, see the [main documentation index](README.md).*\n"},"currentPath":"atrcp"},"__N_SSG":true}
