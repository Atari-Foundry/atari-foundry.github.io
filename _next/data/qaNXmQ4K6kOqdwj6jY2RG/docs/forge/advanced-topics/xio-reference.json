XIO Reference\n\nXIO (eXtended Input/Output) commands provide access to device-specific CIO operations beyond the standard open, close, get, put, and print commands.\n\n## Overview\n\nXIO allows you to execute special device-specific commands that are not available through standard CIO operations. Each device handler can implement its own set of XIO commands.\n\n## Syntax\n\n### XIO #_iochn_, _cmd_, _aux1_, _aux2_, *dev* / X.\n\nPerforms a general input/output operation on device *dev*, over channel _iochn_, with the command _cmd_ and auxiliary bytes _aux1_ and _aux2_.\n\n**Note:** The arguments of `XIO` statements are in different order than Atari BASIC, for consistency with other statements the _iochn_ is the first argument.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nXIO #1, 33, 0, 0, \"D:FILE.TXT\"  ' Delete file\n```\n\n## Standard XIO Command Codes\n\nThese commands are supported by most device handlers:\n\n| Code | Operation | Description |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| 3    | OPEN      | Open a channel (same as OPEN statement) |\n| 5    | GET RECORD | Get a record (same as INPUT) |\n| 7    | GET CHARACTERS | Get characters (same as GET) |\n| 8    | PUT RECORD | Put a record |\n| 11   | PUT CHARACTERS | Put characters (same as PUT) |\n| 12   | CLOSE     | Close a channel (same as CLOSE statement) |\n| 13   | STATUS REQUEST | Get device status (same as STATUS statement) |\n| 17   | DRAW LINE | Draw a line (graphics) |\n| 18   | FILL      | Fill area (graphics) |\n\n## Disk File Operations\n\nThese commands are typically used with disk drives (D: device):\n\n| Code | Operation | Description |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| 32   | RENAME    | Rename a file |\n| 33   | DELETE    | Delete a file |\n| 35   | LOCK FILE | Lock a file (prevent deletion) |\n| 36   | UNLOCK FILE | Unlock a file |\n| 37   | POINT     | Set file position |\n| 38   | NOTE      | Get file position |\n| 40   | LOAD BINARY FILE | Load binary file |\n| 41   | SAVE BINARY FILE | Save binary file (Atari DOS, SpartaDOS 2.3/3.2) |\n\n**Example - Delete a file:**\n```basic\nXIO #1, 33, 0, 0, \"D:OLD.TXT\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error deleting file\"\n```\n\n**Example - Rename a file:**\n```basic\nXIO #1, 32, 0, 0, \"D:OLD.TXT,D:NEW.TXT\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error renaming file\"\n```\n\n## Directory Operations\n\nDirectory operations vary by DOS version:\n\n### MyDOS\n\n| Code | Operation |\n|------|-----------|\n| 34   | CREATE DIRECTORY |\n| 41   | CHANGE DIRECTORY |\n\n### SpartaDOS\n\n| Code | Operation |\n|------|-----------|\n| 34   | LOCK DISK (SpartaDOS 2.3/3.2) |\n| 39   | GET FILE LENGTH |\n| 41   | SAVE BINARY FILE (SpartaDOS 2.3/3.2) |\n| 42   | CREATE DIRECTORY |\n| 43   | DELETE DIRECTORY |\n| 44   | CHANGE DIRECTORY |\n| 45   | SET BOOT FILE |\n| 46   | UNLOCK DISK (SpartaDOS 2.3/3.2) |\n| 49   | SET FILE ATTRIBUTES (SpartaDOS X) |\n\n## Disk Formatting\n\n| Code | Operation | Description |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| 253  | FORMAT SINGLE DENSITY | Format disk (DOS 2.5) |\n| 254  | FORMAT DISK | Format disk (default format) |\n\n**Warning:** Formatting operations will erase all data on the disk!\n\n## NOTE and POINT\n\nWhile `NOTE` and `POINT` are available as XIO commands (codes 38 and 37), FORGE provides built-in `NOTE` and `POINT` statements that are safer and easier to use:\n\n**XIO method (not recommended):**\n```basic\n' Get file position\nXIO #1, 38, 0, 0, \"D:FILE.TXT\"\nSEC = PEEK(ICBLL)  ' Low byte\nBYT = PEEK(ICBLH)  ' High byte (actually byte offset)\n```\n\n**FORGE method (recommended):**\n```basic\nNOTE #1, SEC, BYT  ' Much simpler and safer!\n```\n\nSee [NOTE/POINT](note-point.md) for complete documentation.\n\n## Device-Specific Commands\n\nDifferent devices may support additional XIO commands. Consult the device documentation for specific commands.\n\n### R: Device Commands\n\nR: devices (serial ports) may support additional commands for:\n- Setting baud rate\n- Configuring serial parameters\n- Controlling modem functions\n\nSee [R: Handler](../reference/r-handler.md) for details.\n\n### Graphics Commands\n\nGraphics devices support commands like:\n- DRAW LINE (17)\n- FILL (18)\n\n## Error Handling\n\nAlways check `ERR()` after XIO operations:\n\n```basic\nXIO #1, 33, 0, 0, \"D:FILE.TXT\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN\n  ? \"XIO Error: \"; ERR()\nENDIF\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Delete a File\n\n```basic\nXIO #1, 33, 0, 0, \"D:FILE.TXT\"\nIF ERR() = 1 THEN\n  ? \"File deleted\"\nELSE\n  ? \"Error: \"; ERR()\nENDIF\n```\n\n### Rename a File\n\n```basic\nXIO #1, 32, 0, 0, \"D:OLD.TXT,D:NEW.TXT\"\nIF ERR() = 1 THEN\n  ? \"File renamed\"\nELSE\n  ? \"Error: \"; ERR()\nENDIF\n```\n\n### Lock/Unlock a File\n\n```basic\n' Lock file\nXIO #1, 35, 0, 0, \"D:IMPORTANT.TXT\"\n\n' Later, unlock file\nXIO #1, 36, 0, 0, \"D:IMPORTANT.TXT\"\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use FORGE statements when available** - `NOTE`/`POINT` statements are safer than XIO\n2. **Always check errors** - Use `ERR()` after every XIO call\n3. **Document device-specific commands** - Different devices support different commands\n4. **Test thoroughly** - XIO commands can have device-specific behavior\n5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Some commands may fail on certain devices\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**XIO fails:**\n- Check channel is open (if required)\n- Verify command code is supported by device\n- Check device name is correct\n- Verify aux parameters are correct\n\n**Unexpected behavior:**\n- Consult device-specific documentation\n- Check DOS version compatibility\n- Verify command parameters\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [CIO Reference](cio-reference.md) - Central I/O operations\n- [NOTE/POINT](note-point.md) - File positioning (preferred over XIO 37/38)\n- [Statements](../language-reference/statements.md) - FORGE I/O statements\n- [R: Handler](../reference/r-handler.md) - Serial port operations\n"},"currentPath":"advanced-topics/xio-reference"},"__N_SSG":true}
