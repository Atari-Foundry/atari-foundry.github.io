FujiNet\n\n*NOTE:* The FujiNet Statements are not available in the integer-only version.\n\nFujiNet is a modern network adapter for the Atari 8-bit computers that provides WiFi connectivity and emulates disk drives over the network.\n\n## Overview\n\nThese are statements that talk to the FujiNet network adapter, and can be used to open network connections, using any protocol supported.\n\nEach of these statements require a _unit_ number, of which 8 are available, numbered 1-8.\n\n## General Flow\n\nThe general flow of use is:\n\n1. `NOPEN` a connection\n2. In a loop:\n   - Check for any traffic with `NSTATUS`\n   - `NGET` if needed\n   - Send any traffic with `NPUT`\n3. When done, `NCLOSE`\n\n## Opening a Connection\n\n### NOPEN _unit_, _mode_, _trans_, _url_ / NO.\n\n**Open A Network Connection**\n\nUses `N:` _unit_ to open a connection to _url_ using the desired _mode_ and _trans_ settings.\n\n**Example URLs:**\n```\nN:HTTPS://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\nN:TCP://example.com:80\nN:UDP://192.168.1.1:1234\n```\n\n**Common _modes_:**\n\n| Mode | Description | HTTP Equivalent |\n|------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 4    | READ        | GET             |\n| 6    | DIRECTORY   | PROPFIND        |\n| 8    | WRITE       | PUT             |\n| 12   | READ/WRITE  | TCP             |\n| 13   | -           | POST            |\n\n**Common _trans_ (translation modes):**\n\n| Mode | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 0    | No translation of characters |\n| 1    | Change CR to ATASCII EOL |\n| 2    | Change LF to ATASCII EOL |\n| 3    | Change CR and LF to EOL |\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\n' Open HTTP connection for reading\nNOPEN 1, 4, 0, \"N:HTTPS://example.com/file.txt\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error opening connection\"\n```\n\n## Closing a Connection\n\n### NCLOSE _unit_ / NC.\n\n**Close A Network Connection**\n\nCloses a network connection _unit_ previously opened by `NOPEN`.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nNCLOSE 1\n```\n\n## Checking Connection Status\n\n### NSTATUS _unit_ / NS.\n\n**Get Network Connection Status**\n\nQueries the status of specified network _unit_. The result is stored in `DVSTAT` starting at `$02EA`, and has the format:\n\n| Address | Description             |\n|---------|-------------------------|\n| $02EA   | # of bytes waiting (LO) |\n| $02EB   | # of bytes waiting (HI) |\n| $02EC   | Connected? (0 or 1)     |\n| $02ED   | Most recent error #     |\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nNSTATUS 1\nBYTES_WAITING = DPEEK($02EA)\nCONNECTED = PEEK($02EC)\nERROR = PEEK($02ED)\n\nIF CONNECTED = 1 THEN\n  ? \"Connected, \"; BYTES_WAITING; \" bytes waiting\"\nELSE\n  ? \"Not connected, error: \"; ERROR\nENDIF\n```\n\n## Reading Data\n\n### NGET _unit_, _addr_, _len_ / NG.\n\n**Read Bytes From Network To _addr_**\n\nReads _len_ bytes from the network connection and stores them at memory address _addr_.\n\n**Important:** When reading, _len_ must be less than, or equal to the number of bytes waiting to be received, or an SIO error will result. Therefore, it is a good idea to figure out how many bytes are waiting using the `NSTATUS` command.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nDIM buffer(1024) BYTE\n\nNSTATUS 1\nBYTES = DPEEK($02EA)\n\nIF BYTES > 0 THEN\n  IF BYTES > 1024 THEN BYTES = 1024\n  NGET 1, ADR(buffer), BYTES\n  IF ERR() = 1 THEN\n    ? \"Read \"; BYTES; \" bytes\"\n  ENDIF\nENDIF\n```\n\n## Writing Data\n\n### NPUT _unit_, _addr_, _len_ / NP.\n\n**Write Bytes To Network From _addr_**\n\nWrites _len_ bytes to the network connection from memory address _addr_.\n\nWhen writing, _len_ must be less than, or equal to the number of bytes in the source buffer.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nDIM data(100) BYTE\n' Fill data array...\nNPUT 1, ADR(data), 100\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error writing data\"\n```\n\n## Complete Example: HTTP GET\n\n```basic\n' Open HTTP connection\nNOPEN 1, 4, 0, \"N:HTTPS://example.com/file.txt\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN\n  ? \"Error opening: \"; ERR()\n  END\nENDIF\n\n' Wait for connection\nREPEAT\n  NSTATUS 1\n  CONNECTED = PEEK($02EC)\n  PAUSE 1\nUNTIL CONNECTED = 1\n\n' Read data\nDIM buffer(4096) BYTE\nTOTAL = 0\n\nREPEAT\n  NSTATUS 1\n  BYTES = DPEEK($02EA)\n  IF BYTES > 0 THEN\n    IF BYTES > 4096 THEN BYTES = 4096\n    NGET 1, ADR(buffer), BYTES\n    IF ERR() = 1 THEN\n      TOTAL = TOTAL + BYTES\n      ' Process buffer...\n    ENDIF\n  ENDIF\n  PAUSE 1\nUNTIL BYTES = 0\n\n' Close connection\nNCLOSE 1\n? \"Received \"; TOTAL; \" bytes total\"\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nAlways check `ERR()` after network operations:\n\n```basic\nNOPEN 1, 4, 0, \"N:HTTPS://example.com/file.txt\"\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN\n  ? \"Open failed: \"; ERR()\n  END\nENDIF\n```\n\nCommon error codes:\n- `1` - Success\n- `>127` - Error (check `DVSTAT` for details)\n\n## SIO Commands\n\nFor advanced usage, you can use SIO commands directly. See [SIO Operations](sio-operations.md) for details.\n\nFor complete SIO command documentation, see:\n[SIO Commands for FujiNet Devices](https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/fujinet-platformio/wiki/SIO-Commands-for-Device-IDs-%2471-to-%2478)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always check connection status** - Use `NSTATUS` before reading/writing\n2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Check `ERR()` after every operation\n3. **Use appropriate buffer sizes** - Don't read more bytes than available\n4. **Close connections properly** - Always call `NCLOSE` when done\n5. **Handle timeouts** - Network operations can take time\n6. **Use HTTPS for secure connections** - When available\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Connection fails:**\n- Check WiFi is connected\n- Verify URL is correct\n- Check FujiNet device is responding\n- Try HTTP instead of HTTPS\n\n**No data received:**\n- Check connection status with `NSTATUS`\n- Verify bytes are waiting\n- Check error codes in `DVSTAT`\n\n**Data corruption:**\n- Verify buffer size matches bytes available\n- Check buffer address is correct\n- Ensure buffer is not overwritten\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [SIO Operations](sio-operations.md) - Low-level SIO interface\n- [CIO Reference](cio-reference.md) - Central I/O operations\n- [XIO Reference](xio-reference.md) - Extended I/O commands\n- [Statements](../language-reference/statements.md) - Complete statement reference\n"},"currentPath":"advanced-topics/fujinet"},"__N_SSG":true}
