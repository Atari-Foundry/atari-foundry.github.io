NOTE and POINT\n\nThe `NOTE` and `POINT` statements provide native random-access file positioning in FORGE, enabling indexed record retrieval and efficient file operations.\n\n## Overview\n\n`NOTE` and `POINT` allow you to:\n\n- Write a file sequentially\n- Remember \"where you are\" (sector + byte)\n- Later jump back to an exact spot for indexed retrieval\n\nThis is the classic Atari BASIC method for:\n- Mailing list databases (records)\n- User/password/email databases\n- Message bases (BBS)\n- Fast \"index files\" (record pointers)\n\n## Syntax\n\n### NOTE #_iochn_, _sectVar_, _byteVar_ / NO.\n\n**Get Current File Position**\n\nGets the current file position for channel _iochn_ and stores the sector number (16-bit) into _sectVar_ and the byte offset within the sector (8-bit) into _byteVar_.\n\n- `#_iochn_` - IOCB channel number (like `#1`)\n- `_sectVar_` - 16-bit integer destination (sector, 0-65535)\n- `_byteVar_` - 8-bit integer destination (byte offset, 0-255)\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nNOTE #1, SEC, BYT\n```\n\n### POINT #_iochn_, _sectExpr_, _byteExpr_ / PO.\n\n**Set File Position**\n\nSets the file position for channel _iochn_ to the specified sector _sectExpr_ (16-bit) and byte offset _byteExpr_ (8-bit) within that sector.\n\n- `#_iochn_` - IOCB channel number\n- `_sectExpr_` - Sector number expression (0-65535)\n- `_byteExpr_` - Byte offset expression (0-255)\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nPOINT #1, SEC, BYT\n```\n\n## Semantics\n\n### NOTE Behavior\n\n`NOTE` captures the **current logical file position** for that channel.\n\n- The returned `(sector, byte)` represents where the *next* read/write will occur.\n- After `INPUT #1, A$`, `NOTE` would report the position *after that line*.\n\n### POINT Behavior\n\n`POINT` moves the channel to the requested file position:\n\n- The *next* read/write starts from that spot\n- This enables **indexed / random access reads**\n\n## Device Support\n\n### Works With\n\n- `\"D:\"` disk files (DOS/CIO handlers that implement NOTE/POINT)\n- Most normal filesystem-backed handlers\n\n### Undefined / Error-Prone On\n\n- Screen/editor devices (`\"E:\"`, `\"K:\"`)\n- Devices that don't implement seek (depends on handler)\n\n**Rule:** If the handler can't do it, `ERR()` will report a CIO error.\n\n## Types and Ranges\n\nFORGE uses 16-bit integers by default, so:\n\n- `sectVar`: `0..65535` (WORD)\n- `byteVar`: `0..255` (BYTE, but stored as integer)\n\nTypical DOS-style use is `byteVar` in the **0..127** range (128-byte sectors), but the compiler should not enforce that — let the handler decide.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf `NOTE` or `POINT` fails, it behaves like other CIO calls:\n\n- `ERR()` is set to the CIO status code\n- Caller can check like:\n\n```basic\nNOTE #1, S, B\nIF ERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"NOTE failed: \"; ERR()\n```\n\n**Common failure reasons:**\n- Channel not open\n- Device doesn't support NOTE/POINT\n- Invalid position (POINT out of range)\n\n## AUX1 Preservation\n\n**Built-in behavior requirement:**\n\n✅ `NOTE` and `POINT` must internally use the *same AUX1 mode used when OPEN was performed*  \n✅ No user-visible `AUX1` parameter  \n✅ No \"4 vs 8 mismatch\" bugs\n\nThis automatic AUX1 preservation makes `NOTE`/`POINT` safer than manual XIO calls.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Indexed Record Retrieval\n\n**Write a file and build a pointer index in RAM:**\n\n```basic\nDIM SEC(200), BYT(200)\nN=0\n\nOPEN #1,8,0,\"D:USERS.DAT\"\n\nFOR I=1 TO 10\n  ' save the position where this record starts\n  NOTE #1, SEC(N), BYT(N)\n  \n  PRINT #1,\"user\";I;\",pass\";I;\",email\";I;\"@site.com\"\n  N=N+1\nNEXT I\n\nCLOSE #1\n? \"Wrote \";N;\" records.\"\n```\n\n**Later: open and jump directly to record #5:**\n\n```basic\nOPEN #1,4,0,\"D:USERS.DAT\"\n\nREC=5\nPOINT #1, SEC(REC), BYT(REC)\nINPUT #1,A$\n? \"Record \";REC;\": \";A$\n\nCLOSE #1\n```\n\nThis is **exactly** how you build:\n- User DB lookups\n- Message retrieval by record number\n- Indexed reads without scanning the whole file\n\n### Example 2: BBS Message Base\n\nAppend-only message bases are perfect for NOTE/POINT because old pointers never move.\n\n**Writing messages:**\n\n```basic\nDIM MSGSEC(500), MSGBYT(500)\nMSGCNT=0\n\nOPEN #1,8,0,\"D:MSGS.TXT\"\n\n' Store where message starts\nNOTE #1, MSGSEC(MSGCNT), MSGBYT(MSGCNT)\n\nPRINT #1,\"[MSG #\";MSGCNT;\"] Hello world!\"\nMSGCNT=MSGCNT+1\n\nCLOSE #1\n```\n\n**Reading back message #0 later:**\n\n```basic\nOPEN #1,4,0,\"D:MSGS.TXT\"\nPOINT #1, MSGSEC(0), MSGBYT(0)\nINPUT #1,A$\n? A$\nCLOSE #1\n```\n\n### Example 3: Building an Index File\n\n```basic\n' Write data file and index\nDIM INDEX_SEC(1000), INDEX_BYT(1000)\nREC_COUNT = 0\n\nOPEN #1, 8, 0, \"D:DATA.TXT\"\nOPEN #2, 8, 0, \"D:INDEX.DAT\"\n\nFOR I = 1 TO 100\n  ' Save position before writing record\n  NOTE #1, INDEX_SEC(REC_COUNT), INDEX_BYT(REC_COUNT)\n  \n  ' Write record\n  PRINT #1, \"Record \"; I; \" data here\"\n  \n  ' Save index entry\n  PRINT #2, INDEX_SEC(REC_COUNT), INDEX_BYT(REC_COUNT)\n  \n  REC_COUNT = REC_COUNT + 1\nNEXT I\n\nCLOSE #1\nCLOSE #2\n```\n\n**Using the index:**\n\n```basic\n' Read index\nDIM INDEX_SEC(1000), INDEX_BYT(1000)\nREC_COUNT = 0\n\nOPEN #2, 4, 0, \"D:INDEX.DAT\"\nREPEAT\n  INPUT #2, INDEX_SEC(REC_COUNT), INDEX_BYT(REC_COUNT)\n  REC_COUNT = REC_COUNT + 1\nUNTIL ERR() <> 1\nCLOSE #2\n\n' Read specific record\nOPEN #1, 4, 0, \"D:DATA.TXT\"\nREC_NUM = 42\nPOINT #1, INDEX_SEC(REC_NUM), INDEX_BYT(REC_NUM)\nINPUT #1, RECORD$\n? \"Record \"; REC_NUM; \": \"; RECORD$\nCLOSE #1\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Save positions before writing** - Use `NOTE` before each record write\n2. **Store indexes in arrays** - Keep sector/byte pairs in memory for fast access\n3. **Validate positions** - Check `ERR()` after `NOTE` and `POINT`\n4. **Use consistent file modes** - Open files the same way when reading/writing\n5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Some devices don't support NOTE/POINT\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**NOTE/POINT fails:**\n- Check channel is open\n- Verify device supports NOTE/POINT\n- Check `ERR()` for specific error code\n\n**Wrong position returned:**\n- Ensure file was opened with correct mode\n- Check for file modifications between NOTE and POINT\n- Verify sector/byte values are correct\n\n**Data corruption:**\n- Don't modify file between NOTE and POINT\n- Ensure file is closed properly\n- Check for concurrent access\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [Statements](../language-reference/statements.md) - Complete statement reference\n- [CIO Reference](cio-reference.md) - Central I/O operations\n- [XIO Reference](xio-reference.md) - Extended I/O commands\n- [Device I/O](../language-reference/statements.md#device-input-and-output-statements) - File operations\n"},"currentPath":"advanced-topics/note-point"},"__N_SSG":true}
