Why FORGE\n\nFORGE was created to provide a modern BASIC interpreter for the Atari 8-bit computers with enhanced features and capabilities. The project focuses on expanding the core compiler suite, providing deeper I/O primitives, and making build-time conveniences first-class features rather than external workarounds.\n\nFORGE is designed to be a fast, modern development environment that turns commonly-needed enhancements into built-in, supported features. The project prioritizes:\n\n- **Enhanced compiler suite** - Stronger compiler behavior and optimization\n- **Deeper I/O primitives** - Native support for advanced I/O operations\n- **Build-time conveniences** - Integrated tools and features for modern development workflows\n- **Performance** - Fast execution through optimized code generation\n- **Modern features** - Support for modular code organization and advanced programming techniques\n\n"},"currentPath":"about/why-forge"},"__N_SSG":true}
