Introduction\n\n`FORGE` is a fast interpreter for the BASIC language on the Atari 8-bit computers.\n\n## Key Differences from Other BASICs\n\n### No Line Numbers\n\nOne big difference from other BASIC interpreters in 1980s era 8-bit computers is the lack of line numbers, as well as an integrated full-screen editor. This is similar to newer programming environments, giving the programmer a higher degree of flexibility.\n\n### Integer-First Design\n\nAnother big difference is that default variables and operations are done using integer numbers; this is one of the reasons that the programs run so fast relative to its peers from the 1980s.\n\n### Runtime Code Generation\n\nThe other reason is that the program is parsed on run, generating optimized code for very fast execution.\n\n## Current Features\n\nFORGE supports:\n\n- **Integer and floating point variables**, including all standard arithmetic operators.\n- **All graphic, sound, and color commands** from Atari BASIC, plus some extensions from TurboBASIC XL.\n- **All control flow structures** from Atari BASIC and TurboBASIC XL.\n- **Automatic string variables** of up to 255 characters.\n- **Arrays** of \"word\", \"byte\", floating point and strings.\n- **User defined functions and procedures** using `FUNC`/`ENDFUNC`, with integer parameters.\n- **Modular code organization** with INCLUDE directives.\n- **Compilation to binary loadable files**.\n- **Multiple versions available**:\n  - Full version `FORGE.COM` (floating point)\n  - Integer-only `FORGEI.COM` (smaller, faster)\n  - Command-line compiler `FORGEC.COM` (floating point)\n  - Command-line compiler `FORGECI.COM` (integer-only)\n\n## Performance\n\nFORGE is designed for speed:\n\n- **2 times faster** than compiled TurboBasicXL in benchmarks\n- **6 times faster** than OSS Integer Basic\n- Small runtime footprint (less than 3k)\n- Fast execution through optimized code generation\n\n## Getting Started\n\nReady to start programming? See [First Steps](first-steps.md) to write your first FORGE program.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [First Steps](first-steps.md) - Write your first program\n- [Compiling](compiling.md) - Compile programs to executables\n- [Language Reference](../language-reference/syntax.md) - Learn the language syntax\n"},"currentPath":"getting-started/introduction"},"__N_SSG":true}
