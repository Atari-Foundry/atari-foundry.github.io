Compiling Programs\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your program, you can compile it to a disk file, producing a program that can be run directly from DOS.\n\n## Compiling from the IDE\n\nPress `CONTROL` and `W` and type a filename for your compiled program.\n\n### File Extensions\n\nIt is common practice to name your compiled programs with an extension of `.COM` or `.XEX`:\n\n- **`.COM`** - With `.COM` extension files you don't need to type the extension in some versions of DOS on the Atari.\n- **`.XEX`** - The `.XEX` name is common in modern times to distinguish Atari executables from MSDOS/Windows programs (which are usually `.EXE` or sometimes `.COM`)\n\n### Standalone Executables\n\nCompiled programs include the full FORGE runtime, so you can distribute them alone without the IDE.\n\n## Command-Line Compiler\n\nYou can also compile a program directly from DOS by using the included command line compiler `FORGEC.COM`. You can provide the BASIC source and the compiled output file names in the command line; if not given the compiler will prompt you to input a file name.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```dos\nFORGEC source.bas\n```\n\nThis will compile `source.bas` to `source.xex`.\n\n### Specifying Output File\n\n```dos\nFORGEC source.bas output.com\n```\n\nThis will compile `source.bas` to `output.com`.\n\n### Integer-Only Compiler\n\nIf you don't use floating point, using the integer versions (`FORGEI` and `FORGECI`) will compile to a smaller file:\n\n```dos\nFORGECI source.bas\n```\n\n## File Size Considerations\n\n### Floating Point vs Integer\n\n- **Floating point version** (`FORGEC`): Larger file size, supports all features\n- **Integer version** (`FORGECI`): Smaller file size, no floating point support\n\nChoose the integer version if:\n- You don't need floating point calculations\n- You want the smallest possible executable\n- You're targeting memory-constrained systems\n\n### Optimization Tips\n\n- Use integer variables when possible\n- Avoid unnecessary floating point operations\n- Use `DIM` to pre-allocate arrays instead of dynamic allocation\n- Remove unused code and variables\n\n## Compilation Process\n\nThe compilation process:\n\n1. **Parse** - The source code is parsed and validated\n2. **Generate** - Optimized code is generated\n3. **Link** - Code is linked with the FORGE runtime\n4. **Output** - Executable file is created\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf compilation fails:\n\n- Check the error message for the line number\n- Verify syntax is correct\n- Ensure all referenced functions/statements exist\n- Check for missing variable declarations\n\n## Advanced Compilation\n\nFor more advanced compilation options, see the [Cross-Compiler Usage Guide](../compiler/USAGE.md) which covers:\n\n- Multiple compilation targets\n- Custom linker configurations\n- Include paths\n- Debug symbols\n- Optimization options\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Compilation\n\n```dos\nFORGEC hello.bas\n```\n\nCompiles `hello.bas` to `hello.xex`.\n\n### With Custom Output\n\n```dos\nFORGEC game.bas GAME.COM\n```\n\nCompiles `game.bas` to `GAME.COM`.\n\n### Integer Version\n\n```dos\nFORGECI utility.bas\n```\n\nCompiles `utility.bas` to `utility.xex` using integer-only runtime.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Cross-Compiler Usage](../compiler/USAGE.md) - Advanced compilation options\n- [Language Reference](../language-reference/syntax.md) - Learn more FORGE features\n- [Advanced Topics](../advanced-topics/) - Explore advanced programming techniques\n"},"currentPath":"getting-started/compiling"},"__N_SSG":true}
