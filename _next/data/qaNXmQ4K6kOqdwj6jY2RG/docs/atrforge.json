atrforge Documentation\n\nWelcome to the comprehensive documentation for **atrforge** - your friendly neighborhood Atari ATR disk image toolkit. Yes, we know it's 2026 and you're still using 8-bit disk images. We're not judging. In fact, we think it's pretty cool.\n\n## What is atrforge?\n\natrforge is a collection of command-line tools for creating, manipulating, extracting, and converting Atari ATR disk images. Whether you're preserving vintage software, developing new Atari 8-bit programs, or just curious about how these old disk formats work, atrforge has you covered.\n\nThe toolkit consists of four main tools:\n\n- **`atrforge`** - Create ATR images from files (the star of the show)\n- **`lsatr`** - List and extract contents from ATR images (the nosy neighbor)\n- **`convertatr`** - Convert and resize ATR images (the shape-shifter)\n- **`atrcp`** - Copy files in and out of ATR images (the file courier)\n\n## Quick Start\n\nIf you're the impatient type (we get it), here's the 30-second version:\n\n```bash\n# Create a disk image\natrforge mydisk.atr file1.com file2.bas\n\n# See what's inside\nlsatr mydisk.atr\n\n# Extract everything\nlsatr -X output/ mydisk.atr\n```\n\nThat's it. You're now an atrforge user. Congratulations! For the full story, keep reading.\n\n## Documentation Index\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- **[Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)** - How to build and install atrforge (it's easier than you think)\n- **[Examples](EXAMPLES.md)** - Real-world usage examples that actually make sense\n\n### Tool Documentation\n\n- **[atrforge](ATRFORGE.md)** - Creating ATR images from scratch (or adding to existing ones)\n- **[lsatr](LSATR.md)** - Listing and extracting files from ATR images\n- **[convertatr](CONVERTATR.md)** - Converting and resizing ATR images\n- **[atrcp](ATRCP.md)** - Copying individual files to and from ATR images\n\n### Technical Reference\n\n- **[ATR Format](ATR_FORMAT.md)** - The gory details of the ATR file format\n- **[DOS Formats](DOS_FORMATS.md)** - Supported filesystems and what they can do\n- **[File Attributes](FILE_ATTRIBUTES.md)** - Making files hidden, protected, or archived\n- **[Boot Files](BOOT_FILES.md)** - Creating bootable disk images (the fun stuff)\n- **[UTF8 Conversion](UTF8_CONVERSION.md)** - Converting between UTF8 and ATASCII (because modern editors are picky)\n\n### Advanced Topics\n\n- **[Advanced Usage](ADVANCED.md)** - For when you want to get fancy\n- **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - When things go wrong (and how to fix them)\n\n### Project Information\n\n- **[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** - History of changes, features, and fixes\n- **[Attributions](ATTRIBUTIONS.md)** - Credits and acknowledgments\n\n## Tool Summary\n\n### atrforge\n\nCreates ATR disk images in SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format. You give it files, it gives you a disk image. Simple as that.\n\n**Best for:** Creating new disk images, making bootable disks, organizing files into disk images\n\n### lsatr\n\nLists and extracts files from ATR images. It's like `ls` and `tar` had a baby, but for 8-bit disk images.\n\n**Best for:** Inspecting disk contents, extracting files, verifying disk images\n\n### convertatr\n\nConverts between different ATR formats and sizes. Need a bigger disk? Different sector size? This is your tool.\n\n**Best for:** Resizing disks, converting sector sizes, batch conversions\n\n### atrcp\n\nCopies individual files between ATR images and your host filesystem. Think `cp`, but for files inside disk images.\n\n**Best for:** Quick file operations, updating single files, UTF8/ATASCII conversion on the fly\n\n## Getting Help\n\nEach tool has built-in help. Just run it with `-h`:\n\n```bash\natrforge -h\nlsatr -h\nconvertatr -h\natrcp -h\n```\n\nFor version information, use `-v`:\n\n```bash\natrforge -v\n```\n\n## What's Next?\n\n- New to atrforge? Start with the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) and then check out [Examples](EXAMPLES.md)\n- Want to create a disk image? Read [atrforge documentation](ATRFORGE.md)\n- Need to extract files? See [lsatr documentation](LSATR.md)\n- Working with boot files? Check out [Boot Files](BOOT_FILES.md)\n- Having problems? Try [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)\n\n## License\n\natrforge is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the main `LICENSE` file in the project root for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a bug? Have a suggestion? Want to contribute? Check out the main project repository. We're always happy to see improvements (especially if they come with documentation).\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026. Because we keep track of these things.*\n"},"currentPath":""},"__N_SSG":true}
