Troubleshooting\n\nThings go wrong. It happens. This guide will help you figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. Most problems have simple solutions. Some don't. We'll cover both.\n\n## Common Error Messages\n\n### \"can't open file\"\n\n**What it means:** The tool can't open the specified file.\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- File doesn't exist\n- Wrong path\n- Permission issues\n- File is locked by another process\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check the file path (typos are common)\n- Verify the file exists: `ls -l filename`\n- Check file permissions: `chmod` if needed\n- Make sure no other program has the file open\n\n### \"not an ATR image\"\n\n**What it means:** The file isn't a valid ATR image.\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- File is corrupted\n- File is in a different format\n- File is empty or incomplete\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the file is actually an ATR image\n- Check file size (ATR files should be at least a few KB)\n- Try downloading/copying the file again\n- Check if it's a different disk image format\n\n### \"invalid ATR image size\"\n\n**What it means:** The ATR header has invalid size information.\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Corrupted header\n- Non-standard ATR file\n- File was truncated\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Try `lsatr --verify` to check the image\n- The tools may auto-correct some size issues\n- If it's a known good image, it might be a tool bug (report it)\n\n### \"can't write to output file\"\n\n**What it means:** Can't write the output file.\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Disk full\n- Permission denied\n- File is read-only\n- Path doesn't exist\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check disk space: `df -h`\n- Check write permissions\n- Make sure the directory exists\n- Check if file is read-only: `chmod` if needed\n\n### \"option needs an argument\"\n\n**What it means:** You used an option that requires an argument but didn't provide one.\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Missing argument after option\n- Wrong option syntax\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check the option syntax in the documentation\n- Make sure arguments come immediately after options that need them\n- Example: `-X output/` not `-Xoutput/` (space matters)\n\n## Image Format Issues\n\n### Image Won't Load\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Image doesn't work in emulator\n- Image doesn't boot\n- Error messages when trying to use image\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Wrong DOS format for target system\n- Corrupted image\n- Incompatible sector size\n- Boot file issues\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify image: `lsatr --verify image.atr`\n- Check DOS format compatibility\n- Try recreating the image\n- Check boot file format and requirements\n\n### Image Too Large\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Error about image size\n- Image creation fails\n- \"image size calculation overflow\"\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Files too large for available disk sizes\n- Maximum size exceeded (16MB limit)\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check total file sizes\n- Use `-x` for exact sizing if needed\n- Split files across multiple disks\n- Maximum ATR size is 16MB (65535 sectors × 256 bytes)\n\n### Image Too Small\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Files don't fit\n- \"not enough space\" errors\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Files are larger than selected disk size\n- Disk size calculation was wrong\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Use a larger disk size (atrforge picks automatically)\n- Use `-s` to specify minimum size\n- Remove some files\n- Check actual file sizes\n\n## File Size Problems\n\n### Files Don't Fit\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Error when adding files\n- Files missing from image\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Files too large for disk\n- Not enough free space\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check file sizes before creating image\n- Use larger disk size\n- Remove unnecessary files\n- Split across multiple disks\n\n### Unexpected File Sizes\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Files appear larger/smaller than expected\n- Size mismatches\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Directory overhead\n- Filesystem overhead\n- Rounding in size calculations\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Some overhead is normal\n- Check actual disk usage, not just file sizes\n- Use `lsatr` to see actual file sizes in image\n\n## Boot File Problems\n\n### Boot File Doesn't Load\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Disk doesn't boot\n- Boot process fails\n- System hangs on boot\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- File not in binary format\n- Bootloader conflict\n- Memory conflicts\n- Corrupted boot file\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify file is in Atari binary format (`.com`, `.xex`)\n- Try relocating bootloader: `atrforge -B 6 -b disk.atr file.com`\n- Check file isn't corrupted\n- Test file separately (not as boot file)\n\n### Bootloader Conflicts\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Boot process starts but fails\n- Memory errors\n- Program doesn't load correctly\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Program loads at same address as bootloader\n- Memory layout conflicts\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Relocate bootloader: `atrforge -B 6 -b disk.atr file.com`\n- Check program's load address\n- Try different bootloader pages (6, 5, or 4)\n\n## Conversion Issues\n\n### UTF8 Conversion Problems\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Files don't work after conversion\n- Characters are wrong\n- Files are corrupted\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Converting binary files (don't do this)\n- Round-trip conversion issues\n- Character encoding problems\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Only convert text files, not binary files\n- Test converted files before using\n- Keep backups of original files\n- Use 7-bit mode if needed: `--7bit`\n\n### Sector Size Conversion Fails\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Conversion doesn't work\n- Data loss\n- Image corruption\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Incompatible DOS format\n- Corrupted source image\n- Size calculation errors\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify source image first: `lsatr --verify source.atr`\n- Check DOS format compatibility\n- Backup before converting\n- Try extracting files and recreating instead\n\n## Permission Problems\n\n### Can't Write Files\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Permission denied errors\n- Can't create output files\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Directory permissions\n- File permissions\n- Read-only filesystem\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check directory permissions: `ls -ld directory`\n- Check file permissions: `ls -l file`\n- Use `chmod` to fix permissions\n- Make sure you have write access\n\n### Can't Read Files\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Permission denied when reading\n- Can't open input files\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- File permissions\n- Directory permissions\n- File ownership\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check file permissions: `ls -l file`\n- Use `chmod` to fix if needed\n- Check if you have read access\n- Check file ownership\n\n## Path Issues\n\n### Path Not Found\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- \"can't find path\" errors\n- Files not found\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Wrong path\n- Path doesn't exist\n- Typo in path\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Double-check the path\n- Use absolute paths if relative paths fail\n- Check for typos\n- Verify directory exists\n\n### Path Traversal Warnings\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Warnings about path components\n- Files not extracted\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Dangerous path components (`..`, absolute paths)\n- Security feature blocking extraction\n\n**Solutions:**\n- This is a security feature (it's working as intended)\n- Sanitize paths in source images\n- Use safe path names\n- Check [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for details\n\n## Memory/Resource Issues\n\n### Out of Memory\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- \"out of memory\" errors\n- Process killed\n- System slowdown\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Very large images (approaching 16MB)\n- System low on memory\n- Too many files\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Close other applications\n- Use smaller images\n- Process images one at a time\n- Increase system memory if possible\n\n### Disk Space Issues\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- \"disk full\" errors\n- Can't write output\n\n**Possible causes:**\n- Disk actually full\n- Quota exceeded\n- Temporary files\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Check disk space: `df -h`\n- Free up disk space\n- Clean temporary files\n- Use different output location\n\n## Build/Installation Issues\n\n### Build
