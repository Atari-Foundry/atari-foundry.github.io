ATTRIBUTES","content":"# File Attributes\n\nAtari disk files can have attributes that control how they behave. Some make files read-only, some hide them from directory listings, and some mark them as archived. It's like file permissions, but simpler (and older).\n\n## Overview\n\nFile attributes are flags that modify how files behave on the Atari. They're stored in the filesystem and affect how the file is displayed, accessed, and modified.\n\n**Supported attributes:**\n- **Protected** (`+p`) - Makes files read-only\n- **Hidden** (`+h`) - Hides files from directory listings\n- **Archived** (`+a`) - Marks files as backed up\n\n**Important:** Attributes are primarily a SpartaDOS-X feature. They may not work (or work differently) in other DOS formats.\n\n## Protected Files (`+p`)\n\nProtected files are read-only. The Atari won't let you delete or modify them without first removing the protection.\n\n### Setting Protection\n\nWhen creating an image with `atrforge`:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +p important.com\n```\n\nThis marks `important.com` as protected.\n\n### What It Does\n\n- **Prevents deletion** - The file can't be deleted (without removing protection first)\n- **Prevents modification** - The file can't be modified\n- **Still readable** - The file can still be read and executed\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- System files that shouldn't be modified\n- Important data files\n- Configuration files\n- Files you want to prevent accidental changes\n\n### Removing Protection\n\nOn the Atari, you can remove protection using DOS commands. atrforge tools don't currently support removing protection (you'd need to recreate the image or use Atari tools).\n\n## Hidden Files (`+h`)\n\nHidden files don't appear in normal directory listings. They're still there, they're just not shown. It's like the Unix `.` prefix, but built into the filesystem.\n\n### Setting Hidden Attribute\n\nWhen creating an image with `atrforge`:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +h secret.com\n```\n\nThis marks `secret.com` as hidden.\n\n### What It Does\n\n- **Hides from listings** - File doesn't appear in normal `DIR` commands\n- **Still accessible** - File can still be accessed if you know the name\n- **SpartaDOS-X only** - Only works in SpartaDOS-X, not in other DOS formats\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- System files you don't want cluttering directory listings\n- Files you want to keep private (though not really secure)\n- Temporary files\n- Backup files\n\n### Viewing Hidden Files\n\nOn SpartaDOS-X, you can view hidden files using special commands or options. Normal directory listings won't show them.\n\n## Archived Files (`+a`)\n\nArchived files are marked as having been backed up. It's a flag that says \"this file has been archived.\" It doesn't actually do anything to the file, it's just a marker.\n\n### Setting Archived Attribute\n\nWhen creating an image with `atrforge`:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +a backup.com\n```\n\nThis marks `backup.com` as archived.\n\n### What It Does\n\n- **Marks as backed up** - Indicates the file has been archived\n- **No functional effect** - Doesn't change file behavior\n- **SpartaDOS-X only** - Only meaningful in SpartaDOS-X\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Files that have been backed up\n- Marking files for backup systems\n- Tracking which files need archiving\n\n## Combining Attributes\n\nYou can combine multiple attributes on a single file:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +ph system.com\n```\n\nThis makes `system.com` both protected and hidden.\n\n### Common Combinations\n\n- **`+ph`** - Protected and hidden (system files)\n- **`+pa`** - Protected and archived (backed up system files)\n- **`+ha`** - Hidden and archived (backed up hidden files)\n- **`+pha`** - All three (the ultimate system file)\n\n## Setting Attributes with atrforge\n\n### Single File\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +p file1.com +h file2.com +a file3.com\n```\n\nEach attribute prefix applies only to the file immediately following it.\n\n### Multiple Files\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr \\\n    +p important1.com \\\n    +p important2.com \\\n    +h secret1.com \\\n    +h secret2.com\n```\n\nYou need to specify the attribute for each file individually.\n\n### In Directories\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr \\\n    system/ +p system/config.sys \\\n    games/ game1.com game2.com\n```\n\nAttributes work the same way in subdirectories.\n\n## Viewing Attributes\n\n### With lsatr\n\nWhen listing files with `lsatr`, attributes may be shown depending on the DOS format and listing mode. SpartaDOS-X format images will show attribute information.\n\n### On the Atari\n\nOn SpartaDOS-X, you can view file attributes using the `DIR` command with appropriate options. The attributes are displayed as flags (P for protected, H for hidden, A for archived).\n\n## Attribute Compatibility\n\n### SpartaDOS-X / BW-DOS\n\n**Full support.** All attributes work as expected.\n\n### Other DOS Formats\n\n**Limited or no support.** Attributes may not be stored or may not function:\n- **Atari DOS** - No attribute support\n- **MyDOS** - Limited attribute support\n- **LiteDOS** - Varies by version\n\nIf you set attributes on files in a SpartaDOS image, they'll work. If you try to read attributes from other formats, you may not see them.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n1. **Use protection for system files** - Protect important files from accidental modification\n2. **Hide temporary files** - Use hidden attribute for files you don't want in listings\n3. **Combine attributes** - Use multiple attributes for maximum control\n4. **Check DOS compatibility** - Make sure your target DOS supports the attributes you're using\n5. **Attributes are per-file** - Each file needs its own attribute prefix\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- **Forgetting the `+`** - It's `+p`, not `-p` or `--protected`. The `+` is important.\n- **Wrong order** - Attributes must come before the filename, not after.\n- **Expecting universal support** - Attributes are primarily a SpartaDOS-X feature.\n- **Thinking hidden = secure** - Hidden files aren't really secure, they're just not shown in listings.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [atrforge](ATRFORGE.md) - How to set attributes when creating images\n- [DOS Formats](DOS_FORMATS.md) - Which formats support attributes\n- [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) - Examples of using attributes\n\n---\n\n*For the complete tool list, see the [main documentation index](README.md).*\n"},"currentPath":"file-attributes"},"__N_SSG":true}
