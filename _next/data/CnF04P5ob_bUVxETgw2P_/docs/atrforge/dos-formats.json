FORMATS","content":"# DOS Formats Support\n\nThe Atari 8-bit world had many different DOS formats. Some were official, some were third-party, and some were... creative. atrforge tools support reading from many of them, and creating images in SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format. Let's talk about what works and what doesn't.\n\n## Creation Support\n\n### SpartaDOS / BW-DOS\n\n**Full read/write support.** This is what `atrforge` creates, and it's what most of the tools work with.\n\n**Features:**\n- Up to 16MB images\n- Subdirectories\n- File attributes (protected, hidden, archived)\n- Long filenames (up to 11 characters, 8.3 format)\n- Efficient filesystem structure\n\n**Why this format?** It's widely supported, efficient, and has all the features you need. It's the format of choice for most modern Atari software.\n\n## Read-Only Support\n\nThese formats can be read and extracted, but not created or modified by atrforge tools:\n\n### Atari DOS 1.0\n\nThe original Atari DOS. Single density only (90k disks).\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Single density only\n- No subdirectories\n- Simple file structure\n- 64 files maximum per disk\n\n**When you'll see it:** Old software, original Atari disks from the early 1980s.\n\n### Atari DOS 2.0\n\nThe improved Atari DOS. Supports both single and double density.\n\n**Features:**\n- Single and double density\n- Better file management\n- Still no subdirectories\n- 64 files maximum per disk\n\n**When you'll see it:** Most commercial Atari software from the mid-1980s.\n\n### Atari DOS 2.5\n\nEnhanced density support. The last official Atari DOS.\n\n**Features:**\n- Single, double, and enhanced density (130k)\n- Improved file handling\n- Still no subdirectories\n- 64 files maximum per disk\n\n**When you'll see it:** Later Atari software, enhanced density disks.\n\n### MyDOS\n\nA popular third-party DOS that supports large disks.\n\n**Features:**\n- Up to 16MB images\n- Subdirectories\n- Better file management than Atari DOS\n- More files per disk\n\n**When you'll see it:** Power users, large disk images, modern Atari software.\n\n### LiteDOS 2.x / LiteDOS-SE\n\nLightweight DOS variants. Simple but functional.\n\n**Features:**\n- Basic file management\n- Subdirectory support (in some versions)\n- Smaller footprint than full DOS\n\n**When you'll see it:** Minimal setups, boot disks, specialized applications.\n\n## Special Formats\n\nThese aren't really DOS formats, but they're stored in ATR files:\n\n### BAS2BOOT Images\n\nA bootable image format that contains a BASIC program.\n\n**What it is:** An ATR image with a BASIC program that boots automatically.\n\n**What atrforge does:** Extracts the BASIC file from the image.\n\n**When you'll see it:** Bootable BASIC programs, educational software.\n\n### Howfen DOS Images\n\nA specialized boot image format.\n\n**What it is:** A bootable image with a specific structure.\n\n**What atrforge does:** Extracts the raw BOOT image.\n\n**When you'll see it:** Specialized boot disks, custom boot loaders.\n\n### K-file Boot Images\n\nBoot images that contain XEX files.\n\n**What it is:** A bootable image with an XEX file inside.\n\n**What atrforge does:** Extracts the XEX file.\n\n**When you'll see it:** Game boot disks, executable boot images.\n\n## Format Detection\n\nWhen you use `lsatr` on an ATR image, it tries to detect the format automatically:\n\n1. **SpartaDOS/BW-DOS** - Checks for SpartaDOS filesystem structure\n2. **Howfen DOS** - Checks for Howfen DOS signature\n3. **Atari DOS** - Checks VTOC and directory structure\n4. **MyDOS** - Checks MyDOS signature and structure\n5. **LiteDOS** - Checks LiteDOS signature\n6. **Special formats** - Checks for BAS2BOOT, K-file, etc.\n\nIt tries each format in order until it finds one that works. If none work, it reports that the format isn't supported.\n\n## Compatibility Notes\n\n### What Works\n\n- **Reading:** All listed formats can be read and files extracted\n- **Creating:** Only SpartaDOS/BW-DOS images can be created\n- **Modifying:** Only SpartaDOS/BW-DOS images can be modified (with `-a` or `atrcp`)\n\n### What Doesn't Work\n\n- **Creating other formats:** You can't create Atari DOS, MyDOS, or other format images\n- **Converting formats:** You can't convert between DOS formats (only ATR format conversion)\n- **Some features:** Not all features work with all formats (attributes, subdirectories, etc.)\n\n### Limitations by Format\n\n| Format | Read | Write | Subdirs | Attributes | Max Size |\n|--------|------|-------|---------|------------|----------|\n| SpartaDOS/BW-DOS | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 16MB |\n| Atari DOS 1 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | 90k |\n| Atari DOS 2.0 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | 180k |\n| Atari DOS 2.5 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | 130k |\n| MyDOS | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | 16MB |\n| LiteDOS | ✓ | ✗ | Partial | ✗ | Varies |\n\n## Why Only SpartaDOS/BW-DOS for Creation?\n\nGood question. Here's why:\n\n1. **It's the most capable** - Supports everything you need\n2. **It's widely compatible** - Works with most Atari systems and emulators\n3. **It's what we know** - The tools were designed around this format\n4. **It's efficient** - Good filesystem structure and performance\n\nIf you need other formats, you can:\n- Create in SpartaDOS/BW-DOS, then convert on the Atari\n- Use other tools that support those formats\n- Extract from existing images and work with the files\n\n## Tips for Working with Different Formats\n\n1. **Check format first** - Use `lsatr` to see what format an image uses\n2. **Extract and recreate** - If you need to modify a non-SpartaDOS image, extract files and create a new SpartaDOS image\n3. **Preserve originals** - Keep original images when extracting, in case you need the original format\n4. **Check compatibility** - Make sure your target system supports the format you're creating\n\n## See Also\n\n- [atrforge](ATRFORGE.md) - Creating SpartaDOS/BW-DOS images\n- [lsatr](LSATR.md) - Reading and extracting from various formats\n- [ATR Format](ATR_FORMAT.md) - Technical details about ATR file format\n\n---\n\n*For the complete tool list, see the [main documentation index](README.md).*\n"},"currentPath":"dos-formats"},"__N_SSG":true}
