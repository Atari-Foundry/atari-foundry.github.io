Installation Guide\n\nSo you want to install atrforge? Good choice. It's actually pretty straightforward, which is refreshing in a world where \"just run make\" often means \"spend three hours debugging dependency hell.\"\n\n## System Requirements\n\natrforge is written in C and should compile on any system with a reasonable C compiler. We've tested it on:\n\n- Linux (various distributions)\n- macOS\n- Other Unix-like systems\n\n**Required:**\n- A C compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)\n- Make utility\n- Standard C library\n\nThat's it. No fancy dependencies, no package managers required (though you can use them if you want). We keep it simple.\n\n## Building from Source\n\n### Step 1: Get the Source\n\nIf you're reading this, you probably already have the source. If not, clone the repository or download the source code.\n\n### Step 2: Build It\n\nNavigate to the `atrforge` directory and run:\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nThat's it. Really. If it doesn't work, see the Troubleshooting section below. But it should work. We tested it and everything.\n\nThe build process will:\n1. Create `obj/` directory for object files\n2. Create `bin/` directory for the final binaries\n3. Compile all source files\n4. Link everything together\n5. Place the executables in `bin/`\n\n### Step 3: Use It\n\nThe binaries are now in the `bin/` directory:\n\n- `bin/atrforge`\n- `bin/lsatr`\n- `bin/convertatr`\n- `bin/atrcp`\n\nYou can run them directly, or copy them to somewhere in your PATH (like `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`).\n\n## Installation Options\n\n### Option 1: Use from Build Directory\n\nJust run the binaries from `bin/`:\n\n```bash\n./bin/atrforge disk.atr file.com\n```\n\nSimple, but you'll need to specify the path each time.\n\n### Option 2: Copy to System Path\n\nCopy the binaries to a directory in your PATH:\n\n```bash\nsudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nOr for your user directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/bin\ncp bin/* ~/bin/\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"  # Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n### Option 3: Create Symlinks\n\nCreate symlinks instead of copying:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/atrforge /usr/local/bin/atrforge\nsudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/lsatr /usr/local/bin/lsatr\nsudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/convertatr /usr/local/bin/convertatr\nsudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/atrcp /usr/local/bin/atrcp\n```\n\nThis way, when you rebuild, the symlinks automatically point to the new binaries.\n\n## Build Options\n\nThe Makefile uses standard CFLAGS. You can override them if you want:\n\n```bash\nmake CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=native\"\n```\n\nOr add debug symbols:\n\n```bash\nmake CFLAGS=\"-g -O0\"\n```\n\nWe're not going to judge your optimization choices.\n\n## Version Information\n\natrforge uses semantic versioning. The version is stored in the `VERSION` file and is automatically incremented on each build (the patch level, anyway). To see the version:\n\n```bash\natrforge -v\n```\n\nOr check the `VERSION` file:\n\n```bash\ncat VERSION\n```\n\n## Cleaning Up\n\nTo remove build artifacts:\n\n```bash\nmake clean\n```\n\nThis removes the `obj/` and `bin/` directories and all compiled files. It's like it never happened.\n\nFor a more thorough cleanup:\n\n```bash\nmake distclean\n```\n\nThis does everything `clean` does, plus removes the version stamp file.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"make: command not found\"\n\nYou need to install `make`. On most systems:\n- Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"` (RHEL/CentOS)\n- macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n\n### \"gcc: command not found\"\n\nYou need a C compiler. See above for installation instructions.\n\n### \"Permission denied\"\n\nIf you're trying to install to a system directory, you'll need `sudo`. Or install to your user directory instead.\n\n### Build Errors\n\nIf you get compilation errors:\n1. Make sure you have a recent C compiler\n2. Check that all source files are present\n3. Try `make clean` and rebuild\n4. Check the error message - it usually tells you what's wrong\n\n### Version Increment Issues\n\nThe build system automatically increments the patch version on each build. If this causes issues (it shouldn't), you can manually edit the `VERSION` file. It's just a text file with a version number like `1.0.13`.\n\n## What Gets Built\n\nThe build process creates:\n\n- **Object files** in `obj/` - Intermediate compilation results\n- **Binaries** in `bin/` - The actual programs you'll use\n- **Version header** in `src/version.h` - Generated from `VERSION` file\n\nThe source code stays untouched (unless you edit it, which is encouraged).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you have atrforge installed:\n\n1. Try creating a disk image: `atrforge test.atr somefile.com`\n2. List its contents: `lsatr test.atr`\n3. Read the [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) for more ideas\n4. Check out the [Tool Documentation](README.md#tool-documentation) for detailed usage\n\nWelcome to the club. You're now ready to create, manipulate, and extract Atari disk images like a pro (or at least like someone who read the documentation).\n\n---\n\n*For more information, see the [main documentation index](README.md).*\n"},"currentPath":"installation"},"__N_SSG":true}
