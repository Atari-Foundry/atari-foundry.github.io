atrforge - Create ATR Disk Images\n\n`atrforge` is the tool that started it all. It creates Atari ATR disk images from files you give it. Think of it as a disk image factory that takes your files and packages them into a nice, tidy ATR image that your Atari (or emulator) can actually use.\n\n## Overview\n\natrforge creates ATR disk images in SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format. You provide a list of files, and it figures out the best disk size to fit them all. It's smarter than it looks.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Creates new ATR images from files\n- Adds files to existing ATR images\n- Creates bootable disk images\n- Handles directory structures\n- Sets file attributes (protected, hidden, archived)\n- Converts UTF8 files to ATASCII on the fly\n\n**What it doesn't do:**\n- Read existing disk images (that's `lsatr`'s job)\n- Convert between formats (that's `convertatr`'s job)\n- Make coffee (we're working on it)\n\n## Command Syntax\n\n```bash\natrforge [options] <output_atr> [+attributes] <file_1> [... <file_n>]\n```\n\nThe basic pattern is: options, output file, then your files. Simple enough, right?\n\n## Options\n\n### `-a` - Add to Existing Image\n\nAdds files to an existing ATR image instead of creating a new one. The existing image must be in SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format (because that's what we create, and we're not mind readers).\n\n```bash\natrforge -a existing.atr newfile.com\n```\n\n**Note:** This creates a backup of the original file (with `.bak` extension) before modifying it. Because we're nice like that.\n\n### `-b` - Boot File\n\nMarks the next file as the boot file. This file will be loaded when the Atari boots from the disk. The file must be in standard Atari binary format (`.com`, `.xex`, etc.).\n\n```bash\natrforge -b game.atr mygame.com\n```\n\n**Bootloader requirements:**\n- 128-byte sectors: Bootloader needs 613 bytes, from $700 to $965\n- 256-byte sectors: Bootloader needs 848 bytes, from $700 to $A50\n\nBoth can be relocated with the `-B` option if you need to avoid memory conflicts.\n\n### `-x` - Exact Sector Count\n\nCreates an image with the exact sector count needed for all content. This uses non-standard sector counts and will use 128-byte sectors if the image is smaller than about 8MB.\n\n```bash\natrforge -x custom.atr file1.com file2.bas\n```\n\nUseful when you need a specific size or want to minimize disk space usage. Most of the time, you don't need this.\n\n### `-s <size>` - Minimum Size\n\nSpecifies the minimum size of the output image in bytes. The image will be at least this size (or larger, depending on the standard sizes).\n\n```bash\natrforge -s 360000 disk.atr file.com\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want extra free space on the disk. Combine with `-x` to create images of specific sizes (up to the sector size limit).\n\n### `-B <page>` - Relocate Bootloader\n\nRelocates the bootloader to a different page address. The page is the high byte of the address (so page 7 = $0700, page 6 = $0600, etc.).\n\n```bash\natrforge -B 6 -b game.atr mygame.com\n```\n\n**Why would you need this?** Some games or programs load at low addresses that conflict with the standard bootloader location (page 7, $700). Relocating to page 6, 5, or even 4 can solve this. Just make sure you know what you're doing - wrong addresses can cause your boot file to not work.\n\n**Safe values:** Page 6 is usually safe. Pages 4-5 are possible but riskier.\n\n### `--to-atascii` - Convert UTF8 to ATASCII\n\nConverts files from UTF8 to ATASCII when adding them to the ATR. This is useful when you've edited files in a modern UTF8 editor and need them in ATASCII format for the Atari.\n\n```bash\natrforge --to-atascii disk.atr source.bas\n```\n\nSee [UTF8 Conversion](UTF8_CONVERSION.md) for more details on this process.\n\n### `-h` - Help\n\nShows a brief help message. You're reading the extended version right now.\n\n### `-v` - Version\n\nShows version information. Because sometimes you need to know what version you're running.\n\n## File Attributes\n\nYou can set attributes on individual files by prefixing the filename with attribute flags:\n\n### `+p` - Protected (Read-Only)\n\nMarks the file as protected (read-only). The Atari won't let you delete or modify it.\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +p important.com\n```\n\n### `+h` - Hidden\n\nHides the file from directory listings. This only works in SpartaDOS-X, so don't expect it to work everywhere.\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +h secret.com\n```\n\n### `+a` - Archived\n\nMarks the file as archived. This is a SpartaDOS-X feature that indicates the file has been backed up.\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +a backup.com\n```\n\n### Combining Attributes\n\nYou can combine attributes:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr +ph hidden_protected.com\n```\n\nThis makes the file both hidden and protected. Because sometimes you really don't want people messing with your files.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nTo place files in subdirectories, simply list the directory before the files that go in it:\n\n```bash\natrforge disk.atr games/ game1.com game2.com utils/ util1.com\n```\n\nThis creates:\n- `games/game1.com`\n- `games/game2.com`\n- `utils/util1.com`\n\nDirectories are created automatically. You don't need to create them first. We're helpful like that.\n\n## Disk Size Formats\n\natrforge automatically chooses the smallest standard disk size that fits all your files. The available sizes are:\n\n| Sector Count | Sector Size | Total Size | Name |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|------|\n| 720 | 128 | 90k | SD (Single Density) |\n| 1040 | 128 | 130k | ED (Enhanced Density) |\n| 720 | 256 | 180k | DD (Double Density) |\n| 1440 | 256 | 360k | DSDD (Double-Sided Double Density) |\n| 2048 | 256 | 512k | Hard disk |\n| 4096 | 256 | 1M | Hard disk |\n| 8192 | 256 | 2M | Hard disk |\n| 16384 | 256 | 4M | Hard disk |\n| 32768 | 256 | 8M | Hard disk |\n| 65535 | 256 | 16M | Biggest possible image |\n\nIf you use the `-x` option, it will use non-standard sizes and 128-byte sectors for smaller images.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Image Creation\n\nCreate a simple disk image with a few files:\n\n```bash\natrforge mydisk.atr file1.com file2.bas file3.txt\n```\n\n### Bootable Disk\n\nCreate a bootable disk with a game:\n\n```bash\natrforge -b game.atr mygame.com\n```\n\n### Bootable Disk with DOS\n\nCreate a bootable disk with DOS and a startup file:\n\n```bash\natrforge bwdos.atr dos/ -b +ph dos/xbw130.dos +p startup.bat\n```\n\nThis creates:\n- A bootable disk (`-b`)\n- DOS file is hidden and protected (`+ph`)\n- Startup file is protected (`+p`)\n- DOS is in a subdirectory (`dos/`)\n\n### Adding Files to Existing Image\n\nAdd more files to an existing disk:\n\n```bash\natrforge -a existing.atr newfile1.com newfile2.bas\n```\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nCreate a disk with organized directories:\n\n```bash\natrforge organized.atr \\\n    games/ game1.com game2.com \\\n    utils/ util1.com util2.com \\\n    docs/ readme.txt manual.txt\n```\n\n### Protected System Files\n\nCreate a disk with protected system files:\n\n```bash\natrforge system.atr +p config.sys +p autoexec.bat normal.com\n```\n\n### UTF8 Conversion\n\nConvert UTF8 files to ATASCII when creating the disk:\n\n```bash\natrforge --to-atascii disk.atr edited.bas converted.txt\n```\n\n### Custom Size with Extra Space\n\nCreate a disk with a minimum size for future files:\n\n```bash\natrforge -s 360000 disk.atr current_files.com\n```\n\nThis creates at least a 360k disk, even if the files would fit in a smaller one.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n1. **Order matters for boot files**: The `-b` option applies to the *next* file, so put it right before the boot file.\n\n2. **Attributes apply to one file**: Each `+attribute` prefix only affects the file immediately following it.\n\n3. **Directories are implicit**: Just list the directory name, then the files. No need to create directories first.\n\n4. **Backups are automatic**: When using `-a`, a `.bak` file is created automatically. Don't worry, we've got your back.\n\n5. **Size calculation is smart**: atrforge picks the smallest size that fits. If you need more space, use `-s`.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- **Forgetting `-b` before the boot file**: The boot file won't be bootable if you forget the flag.\n- **Wrong file format for boot**: Boot files must be in Atari binary format. Text files won't work.\n- **Using `-a` on non-SpartaDOS images**: Only works with SpartaDOS/BW-DOS format images.\n- **Attribute syntax**: It's `+p`, not `-p` or `--protected`. The `+` is important.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) - More usage examples\n- [Boot Files](BOOT_FILES.md) - Detailed boot file information\n- [File Attributes](FILE_ATTRIBUTES.md) - More on file attributes\n- [UTF8 Conversion](UTF8_CONVERSION.md) - UTF8/ATASCII conversion details\n- [ATR Format](ATR_FORMAT.md) - Technical details about ATR format\n\n---\n\n*For the complete tool list, see the [main documentation index](README.md).*\n"},"currentPath":"atrforge"},"__N_SSG":true}
