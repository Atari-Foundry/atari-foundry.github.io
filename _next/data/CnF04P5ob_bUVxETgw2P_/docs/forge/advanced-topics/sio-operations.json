SIO Operations\n\nThe Atari Serial Input Output interface is the low-level interface between the Atari 8-bit computers and the serial peripherals, like disk-drives and modems.\n\n## Overview\n\nSIO (Serial Input/Output) is the protocol used by the Atari 8-bit computers to communicate with peripheral devices such as:\n\n- Disk drives\n- Modems\n- Printers\n- Network adapters (FujiNet)\n- Other serial devices\n\n## SIO Statement\n\n### SIO _ddevic_, _dunit_, _dcomnd_, _dstats_, _dbuf_, _dtimlo_, _dbyt_, _daux1_, _daux2_\n\n**Send Any Command Over SIO**\n\nThis function can be used to send any SIO command to any SIO device. For example, this command is used to read or write one sector in a floppy disk, or send special commands to a FujiNet network device.\n\n### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description            |\n|-----------|------------------------|\n| DDEVIC    | Device # (e.g. $71)    |\n| DUNIT     | Unit #                 |\n| DCOMND    | Command # ($00-$FF)    |\n| DSTATS    | Read($40) / Write($80) |\n| DBUF      | Target buffer address  |\n| DTIMLO    | Timeout value          |\n| DBYT      | # of bytes in payload  |\n| DAUX1     | First Aux parameter    |\n| DAUX2     | Second Aux parameter   |\n\nThe meanings of each of these is highly dependent on the target device.\n\n### Example: Reading a Disk Sector\n\n```basic\nDIM sector(128) BYTE\n' Read sector 360 from drive 1\nSIO $31, 1, $52, $40, ADR(sector), 64, 128, 360, 0\nIF SERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error reading sector\"\n```\n\n### Example: Writing a Disk Sector\n\n```basic\nDIM sector(128) BYTE\n' Write sector 360 to drive 1\nSIO $31, 1, $57, $80, ADR(sector), 64, 128, 360, 0\nIF SERR() <> 1 THEN ? \"Error writing sector\"\n```\n\n## SERR() Function\n\n### SERR() / SE.\n\n**Get Last SIO Error Function**\n\nThis function returns the value in `DSTATS`, which contains the error of the last SIO operation from the device.\n\nIn the context of the FujiNet device, can be used, along with `DVSTAT+4` to determine any error from a network operation.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nSIO $71, 1, $FF, $40, ADR(buffer), 64, 0, 0, 0\nIF SERR() <> 1 THEN\n  ? \"SIO error: \"; SERR()\nENDIF\n```\n\n## Common SIO Commands\n\n### Disk Drive Commands\n\n| Command | Value | Description |\n|---------|-------|-------------|\n| Get Status | $53 | Read drive status |\n| Read Sector | $52 | Read a sector |\n| Write Sector | $57 | Write a sector |\n| Write Sector with Verify | $57 | Write and verify |\n\n### Device IDs\n\nCommon device IDs:\n- `$31` - Disk drive (D1:)\n- `$71` - FujiNet device\n- `$50` - Printer\n- `$60` - Modem\n\n## Error Handling\n\nAlways check `SERR()` after an SIO operation:\n\n```basic\nSIO $31, 1, $52, $40, ADR(buffer), 64, 128, 360, 0\nIF SERR() <> 1 THEN\n  ? \"SIO Error: \"; SERR()\n  ' Handle error\nENDIF\n```\n\n## Timeout Values\n\nThe `DTIMLO` parameter specifies the timeout value. Common values:\n- `64` - Standard timeout\n- `128` - Longer timeout for slow devices\n- `32` - Shorter timeout for fast operations\n\n## Buffer Management\n\nThe `DBUF` parameter must point to a valid memory buffer. Use `ADR()` to get the address of arrays:\n\n```basic\nDIM buffer(256) BYTE\nSIO $31, 1, $52, $40, ADR(buffer), 64, 256, 0, 0\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Sector Addressing\n\nFor disk drives, sectors are typically addressed using:\n- `DAUX1` - Sector number (low byte)\n- `DAUX2` - Sector number (high byte) or additional parameter\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\n' Read sector 720 (high byte = 2, low byte = 208)\nSIO $31, 1, $52, $40, ADR(buffer), 64, 128, 208, 2\n```\n\n### Multiple Sector Operations\n\nFor reading/writing multiple sectors, you may need to call SIO multiple times or use device-specific commands.\n\n## FujiNet Integration\n\nSIO is heavily used with FujiNet devices. See [FujiNet](fujinet.md) for more details on network operations.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\n' FujiNet status command\nSIO $71, 1, $E0, $40, ADR(status), 64, 4, 0, 0\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always check errors** - Use `SERR()` after every SIO call\n2. **Use appropriate timeouts** - Adjust `DTIMLO` for your device\n3. **Validate buffer sizes** - Ensure `DBYT` matches your buffer\n4. **Handle device-specific behavior** - Different devices interpret parameters differently\n5. **Test thoroughly** - SIO operations can be device-dependent\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**SIO fails immediately:**\n- Check device ID is correct\n- Verify device is connected and powered\n- Check unit number is valid\n\n**Timeout errors:**\n- Increase `DTIMLO` value\n- Check device is responding\n- Verify cable connections\n\n**Data corruption:**\n- Verify buffer address is correct\n- Check buffer size matches `DBYT`\n- Ensure buffer is not overwritten during operation\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [FujiNet](fujinet.md) - Network operations with FujiNet\n- [CIO Reference](cio-reference.md) - Higher-level I/O operations\n- [XIO Reference](xio-reference.md) - Extended I/O commands\n- [Low-Level Programming](low-level-programming.md) - Memory operations\n"},"currentPath":"advanced-topics/sio-operations"},"__N_SSG":true}
