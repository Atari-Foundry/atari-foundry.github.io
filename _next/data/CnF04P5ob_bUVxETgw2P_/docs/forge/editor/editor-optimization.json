Editor Optimization\n\nTips and tricks to make the FORGE editor faster and more responsive.\n\n## Screen Accelerator\n\nThe FORGE IDE uses the Atari screen handler for writing text, so it is compatible with all 80 column and other expansions available.\n\nAs the original screen handler in the Atari OS is slow, there is a screen accelerator included on the FORGE disk.\n\n### Using EFAST\n\nTo use the accelerator, just type `EFAST` in the DOS prompt, before loading the IDE:\n\n```dos\nEFAST\nFORGE\n```\n\nThis will significantly speed up screen updates and make editing more responsive.\n\n## 80-Column Support\n\nThe FORGE editor is compatible with 80-column display hardware and software. The editor will automatically use the available screen width when an 80-column handler is active.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **More code visible** - See more of your program at once\n- **Better readability** - Longer lines don't wrap awkwardly\n- **Professional appearance** - Modern development environment feel\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWorks with:\n- Hardware 80-column cards\n- Software 80-column drivers\n- Modern emulators with 80-column support\n\n## Performance Tips\n\n### Reduce Screen Updates\n\n- **Avoid rapid cursor movement** - Use `CONTROL-G` to jump to specific lines instead of scrolling\n- **Minimize undo usage** - Undo operations can be slow on large files\n- **Save less frequently during heavy editing** - Save in batches rather than after every change\n\n### Optimize File Size\n\n- **Keep programs reasonably sized** - Very large files may be slower to edit\n- **Use INCLUDE directives** - Split large programs into multiple files\n- **Remove unused code** - Clean up old code that's no longer needed\n\n### System Optimization\n\n- **Close other applications** - Free up memory for the editor\n- **Use integer-only version** - `FORGEI` uses less memory than `FORGE`\n- **Disable unnecessary DOS features** - If using a feature-rich DOS, disable unused features\n\n## Troubleshooting Slow Performance\n\n### If the editor is slow:\n\n1. **Check if EFAST is loaded** - Type `EFAST` before starting FORGE\n2. **Check available memory** - Use `FRE()` function to check free memory\n3. **Reduce program size** - Split large programs into multiple files\n4. **Check for memory conflicts** - Ensure no other programs are using memory\n\n### If screen updates are choppy:\n\n1. **Enable EFAST** - This is the most important optimization\n2. **Check display mode** - Some graphics modes may be slower\n3. **Disable background processes** - Close any resident utilities\n\n## Advanced Optimization\n\n### Memory Management\n\n- **Use `CLR` sparingly** - Only when necessary to free memory\n- **Pre-allocate arrays** - Use `DIM` instead of dynamic allocation\n- **Avoid string concatenation loops** - Use array operations when possible\n\n### Code Organization\n\n- **Use procedures** - Break code into reusable procedures\n- **Use INCLUDE** - Organize code into logical modules\n- **Minimize global variables** - Use local variables in procedures when possible\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use EFAST** - It's the single biggest performance improvement\n2. **Organize code** - Well-organized code is easier to edit\n3. **Use abbreviations** - FORGE statement abbreviations reduce typing\n4. **Save regularly** - But not excessively during active editing\n5. **Keep programs modular** - Use INCLUDE for large projects\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Editor Guide](editor-guide.md) - Complete editor reference\n- [Language Reference](../language-reference/syntax.md) - Learn FORGE features\n- [Compiling](../getting-started/compiling.md) - Compile optimized programs\n"},"currentPath":"editor/editor-optimization"},"__N_SSG":true}
