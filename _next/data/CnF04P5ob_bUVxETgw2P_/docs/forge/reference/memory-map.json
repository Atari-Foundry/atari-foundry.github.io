Memory Map\n\nComplete Atari 8-bit computer memory map reference.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Atari 8-bit computers use a 16-bit address space ($0000-$FFFF), organized into pages of 256 bytes each. Memory is divided into several regions:\n\n- **Pages 0-1**: Zero page and stack\n- **Pages 2-5**: OS database and user workspace\n- **Page 6**: Free user space\n- **Page 7+**: Screen region and program memory\n- **Hardware**: $D000-$D7FF\n- **ROM**: $C000-$FFFF (varies by model)\n\n## Page 0 ($0000-$00FF)\n\n**Zero Page** - The first 256 bytes of memory, used by the OS and available for fast access.\n\n### OS Zero Page ($00-$7F)\n\nThe first half of page zero is reserved for the operating system.\n\n**Important addresses:**\n\n| Address | Hex | Name | Description |\n|---------|-----|------|-------------|\n| $0000-$0001 | $0000-$0001 | LINZBS/LINFLG | Line buffer (OS A) / Line flag (OS X) |\n| $0002-$0003 | $0002-$0003 | CASINI | Cassette initialization vector |\n| $0004-$0005 | $0004-$0005 | RAMLO | Low memory pointer |\n| $0006 | $0006 | TRAMSZ/TRNSMZ | Transmit size (OS A/X) |\n| $0008 | $0008 | WARMST | Warm start flag |\n| $000A-$000B | $000A-$000B | DOSVEC | DOS vector |\n| $000C-$000D | $000C-$000D | DOSINI | DOS initialization vector |\n| $000E-$000F | $000E-$000F | APPMHI | Application high memory |\n| $0010 | $0010 | POKMSK | POKEY mask (IRQEN shadow) |\n| $0011 | $0011 | BRKKEY | Break key flag |\n| $0012-$0014 | $0012-$0014 | RTCLOK | Real-time clock (3 bytes) |\n\n### BASIC/User Zero Page ($80-$FF)\n\nThe top half of page zero is free if BASIC is disabled. BASIC uses all but $CB-$D1. The floating point math routines use $D4-$FF.\n\n**Important addresses:**\n\n| Address | Hex | Name | Description |\n|---------|-----|------|-------------|\n| $0080-$0081 | $0080-$0081 | LOMEM | Low memory pointer |\n| $0082-$0083 | $0082-$0083 | VNTP | Variable name table pointer |\n| $0084-$0085 | $0084-$0085 | VNTD | Variable name table end |\n| $0086-$0087 | $0086-$0087 | VVTP | Variable value table pointer |\n| $00D4-$00DF | $00D4-$00DF | FR0, FRE | Floating point registers |\n| $00E0-$00E5 | $00E0-$00E5 | FR1 | Floating point register 1 |\n| $00E6-$00EB | $00E6-$00EB | FR2 | Floating point register 2 |\n\n## Page 1 ($0100-$01FF)\n\n**Stack** - The 6502 stack. The stack pointer is initialized to $1FF and moves downward as the stack is filled.\n\n## Pages 2-5 ($0200-$05FF)\n\n**OS Database and User Workspace**\n\n### OS Database ($0200-$047F)\n\nOperating system database variables. Parts which are not used in some particular programs may be used for other purposes.\n\n**Important vectors:**\n\n| Address | Hex | Name | Description |\n|---------|-----|------|-------------|\n| $0200-$0201 | $0200-$0201 | VDSLST | Display List Interrupt vector |\n| $0202-$0203 | $0202-$0203 | VPRCED | Peripheral interrupt vector |\n| $0204-$0205 | $0204-$0205 | VINTER | Interrupt vector |\n| $0206-$0207 | $0206-$0207 | VBREAK | Break interrupt vector |\n| $0208-$0209 | $0208-$0209 | VKEYBD | Keyboard interrupt vector |\n| $0210-$0211 | $0210-$0211 | VTIMR1 | Timer 1 vector |\n| $0212-$0213 | $0212-$0213 | VTIMR2 | Timer 2 vector |\n| $0214-$0215 | $0214-$0215 | VTIMR4 | Timer 4 vector |\n| $0216-$0217 | $0216-$0217 | VIMIRQ | Main IRQ vector |\n| $0222-$0223 | $0222-$0223 | VVBLKI | Vertical Blank Immediate vector |\n| $0224-$0225 | $0224-$0225 | VVBLKD | Vertical Blank Deferred vector |\n| $0230-$0231 | $0230-$0231 | SDLSTL, SDLSTH | Display List pointer (shadow) |\n| $0232 | $0232 | SSKCTL | Serial port control (shadow) |\n\n**IOCB Structure:**\n\nIOCB 0 starts at $0340. Each IOCB is 16 bytes:\n\n| Address | Hex | Name | Description |\n|---------|-----|------|-------------|\n| $0340 | $0340 | ICHID | Handler ID (IOCB 0) |\n| $0341 | $0341 | ICDNO | Device number |\n| $0342 | $0342 | ICCOM | Command |\n| $0343 | $0343 | ICSTA | Status |\n| $0344-$0345 | $0344-$0345 | ICBAL, ICBAH | Buffer address |\n| $0346-$0347 | $0346-$0347 | ICPTL, ICPTH | Put routine pointer |\n| $0348-$0349 | $0348-$0349 | ICBLL, ICBLH | Buffer length |\n| $034A-$034F | $034A-$034F | ICAX1-6 | Auxiliary bytes |\n\nIOCB 1 starts at $0350, IOCB 2 at $0360, etc.\n\n### User Workspace ($0480-$05FF)\n\nFree to be used by programs. If the floating point arithmetic package is not used, the user workspace extends to $6FF.\n\n**Floating Point Area ($57E-$5FF):**\n\nUsed by the floating point arithmetic package. Free if the package is not used.\n\n## Page 6 ($0600-$06FF)\n\n**Free User Space** - Atari has solemnly sworn never to put anything in this page of memory. This is safe for user programs.\n\n## Page 7+ ($0700+)\n\n**Screen Region and Program Memory**\n\n### Boot Region ($0700)\n\nMost machine language programs which don't use DOS load at this address. DOS extends from $700-$1CFB.\n\n### MEMLO\n\nThe address pointed to by MEMLO [$02E7,2 (743)] is the first byte of free memory. This pointer is usually changed by any program's initialization routine.\n\n- Upon power-up, MEMLO points to $700\n- When DOS loads, MEMLO changes to point to $2A80\n- AUTORUN.SYS programs change MEMLO to point above themselves\n\n### MEMTOP\n\nMEMTOP [$02E5,2 (741)] is set by the OS whenever a graphics mode is entered. The graphics region is at the very top of RAM and extends downward.\n\n### APPMHI\n\nAPPMHI [$0E,2 (14)] should be set by any program to point to the highest address required by the program. If the OS cannot set up a screen without going below APPMHI it will return a not-enough-memory-for-screen-mode error.\n\n## Cartridge Slots\n\n### Right Cartridge Slot ($8000)\n\nBeginning of the 8K bytes used by the right cartridge slot of the 800. This is also where 16K cartridges begin. If there is no cartridge here it is RAM.\n\n### Left Cartridge Slot ($A000)\n\nBeginning of the left cartridge of the 800 or the only cartridge slot on all other models. This is where the BASIC ROM resides in the XL/XE models. This area is RAM if there is no cartridge or BASIC is disabled on XL/XE models.\n\n## Above Cartridges\n\n### $C000-$CFFF\n\nThis area is empty on the 800. Sometimes special ROM chips, such as Omnimon are wired in here. On the XL/XE models $C000-C7FF is free RAM if there are no cartridges. On XL/XE models, the OS ROM starts at $C800.\n\n## Hardware Registers ($D000-$D7FF)\n\nThis area is taken up by the hardware chips. The chips actually take only a fraction of this space.\n\n**GTIA Registers ($D000-$D01F):**\n- Player/Missile horizontal positions\n- Player/Missile graphics\n- Color registers\n- Collision detection\n\n**POKEY Registers ($D200-$D2FF):**\n- Audio channels\n- Serial I/O\n- Timers\n- Keyboard\n\n**PIA Registers ($D300-$D3FF):**\n- Peripheral interface\n\n**ANTIC Registers ($D400-$D4FF):**\n- Display list control\n- Scrolling\n- Character set\n- Display control\n\nSee [Hardware Registers](hardware-registers.md) for complete details.\n\n## ROM Region\n\n### Character Set ($E000-$E3FF)\n\nLocation of the ATASCII character set.\n\n### OS ROM ($E400-$FFF7)\n\nOperating system ROM.\n\n### Interrupt Vectors ($FFF8-$FFFF)\n\nThese last 8 bytes contain the addresses of the interrupt vectors. Upon power up the 6502 gets a reset pulse and looks up the reset routine here.\n\n## Memory Organization Summary\n\n| Region | Address Range | Description |\n|--------|---------------|-------------|\n| Zero Page | $0000-$00FF | OS and user variables |\n| Stack | $0100-$01FF | 6502 stack |\n| OS Database | $0200-$047F | OS vectors and variables |\n| User Workspace | $0480-$05FF | Free for programs |\n| Page 6 | $0600-$06FF | Free user space |\n| Boot/Program | $0700+ | Program memory |\n| Cartridge A | $8000-$9FFF | Right cartridge (800) or 16K cart |\n| Cartridge B | $A000-$BFFF | Left cartridge (800) or BASIC ROM (XL/XE) |\n| Extended RAM | $C000-$C7FF | Free RAM (XL/XE, no cart) |\n| OS ROM | $C800-$FFFF | Operating system ROM |\n\n## Differences by Model\n\n### Atari 400/800 vs 1200XL vs 600/800XL\n\nSome memory locations have different uses or names between OS versions. Consult the specific OS version documentation for details.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [Hardware Registers](hardware-registers.md) - Hardware register details\n- [Memory Usage](memory-usage.md) - Memory usage guidelines\n- [Low-Level Programming](../advanced-topics/low-level-programming.md) - Memory operations\n"},"currentPath":"reference/memory-map"},"__N_SSG":true}
