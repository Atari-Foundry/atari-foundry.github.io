R: Handler\n\nR: device handler reference for RS-232 serial ports (Atari 850, R:Verter, BOB-Verter).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe R: device is typically a handler for an RS-232 serial port. This serial port can be on an Atari 850, an MIO, Black Box or P:R:Connection from ICD. Most handlers are the same with subtle differences.\n\n## What is an R: Device?\n\nThe R: device is a handler for an RS-232 serial port. This serial port can be on:\n\n- **Atari 850** - Interface module with 4 RS-232 ports\n- **MIO** - Multi I/O interface\n- **Black Box** - Enhanced I/O interface\n- **P:R:Connection** - ICD interface\n- **R:Verter** - Modern serial interface\n- **BOB-Verter** - Modern serial interface\n\n## Atari 850\n\nThe Atari 850 is a computer peripheral for the Atari 8-bit line of computers that was released in 1980. It was called an \"Interface module\" that connected to the SIO port.\n\nIt provided:\n- **4 RS-232 serial ports:**\n  - R1: - Fully functional\n  - R2:-R4: - Did not provide all RS-232 signals\n- **1 parallel port:** P1:\n\n## Opening an R: Device\n\n### OPEN #_channel_, _aux1_, _aux2_, \"R_n_:\"\n\n**Aux1** specifies the direction of the port:\n\n```\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n----------------\n| | | | | | | | |\n----------------\n```\n\n- **Aux1[7:4]** = NOT USED\n- **Aux1[3]** = Specifies Output when high\n- **Aux1[2]** = Specifies Input when high\n- **Aux1[1]** = NOT USED\n- **Aux1[0]** = Specifies Concurrent I/O mode\n\n**Common values:**\n- **4** = Input only\n- **8** = Output only\n- **12** = Input and Output (read/write)\n- **13** = Input and Output with Concurrent I/O mode\n\n**Aux2** is not used.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nOPEN #1, 12, 0, \"R1:\"  ' Open R1: for read/write\n```\n\n## XIO Commands\n\n### XIO 34 - DTR/RTS Control\n\n**XIO 34, #_channel_, _aux1_, _aux2_, \"R_n_:\"**\n\nAux1 bits do the following:\n\n- **Aux1[7]** = DTR control enable (active high)\n- **Aux1[6]** = Force DTR value\n- **Aux1[5]** = RTS control enable (active high)\n- **Aux1[4]** = Force RTS value\n- **Aux1[3:0]** = not used\n\n**To force DTR off:** Aux1 = 128  \n**To force DTR on:** Aux1 = 192\n\nAux2 is unused.\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nXIO 34, #1, 192, 0, \"R1:\"  ' Force DTR on\nXIO 34, #1, 128, 0, \"R1:\"  ' Force DTR off\n```\n\n### XIO 36 - Set Baud Rate and Parameters\n\n**XIO 36, #_channel_, _aux1_, _aux2_, \"R_n_:\"**\n\nAux1 selects the Baud rate, Word size and stop bits.
