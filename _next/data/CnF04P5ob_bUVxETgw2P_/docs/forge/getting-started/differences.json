FORGE Features and Capabilities\n\n## Overview\n\nFORGE (Fast Optimizing Runtime Generation Environment) is a fast BASIC interpreter for the Atari 8-bit computers with modern features and enhanced capabilities. This document describes the key statements, functions, and capabilities available in FORGE.\n\n## New Statements\n\n### FUNC ... ENDFUNC (Replaces PROC/ENDPROC)\n\n**User-Defined Functions and Procedures**\n\nFORGE uses `FUNC`/`ENDFUNC` for both procedures and functions, providing a unified approach to user-defined code.\n\n**Syntax for Procedures (no return value):**\n```basic\nFUNC name param1 param2 ...\n  ' procedure body\nENDFUNC\n```\n\n**Syntax for Functions (with return value):**\n```basic\nFUNC name param1 param2 ...\n  ' function body\n  RETURN expression\nENDFUNC\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- `FUNC` without a return type behaves like the old `PROC` (procedure)\n- `FUNC` with `RETURN` returns a value and can be used in expressions\n- String-returning functions use a `$` suffix (e.g., `FUNC greet$`)\n- Parameters work the same way (integer variables)\n- Can be called with `@` prefix, `EXEC`, or by name in expressions\n- `ENDFUNC` automatically emits `TOK_RET` or `TOK_RET_VAL` based on whether the function has a return type\n\n**Example - Procedure:**\n```basic\nFUNC greet name\n  ? \"Hello, \"; name\nENDFUNC\n\n@greet \"World\"\n```\n\n**Example - Function:**\n```basic\nFUNC add x y\n  RETURN x + y\nENDFUNC\n\nresult = add(10, 20)  ' Returns 30\n```\n\n---\n\n### STATUS #_iochn_, _statusVar_\n\n**Get Device Status**\n\nThe `STATUS` statement queries device status information from an I/O channel.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```basic\nSTATUS #iochn, statusVar\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Calls CIO STATUS operation (command 13) on the specified channel\n- Stores CIO status code in _statusVar_ (1 = success, >127 = error)\n- After successful STATUS call, device-specific information is placed in DVSTAT buffer (memory locations 746-749)\n- Essential for R: device operations (Atari 850, R:Verter, BOB-Verter) to check carrier status, error bits, and buffer counts\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nOPEN #1, 12, 0, \"R1:\"\nSTATUS #1, ST\nIF ST = 1 THEN\n  ERR_BITS = DVSTAT(0)\n  SENSE = DVSTAT(1)\nENDIF\n```\n\n---\n\n### NOTE #_iochn_, _sectVar_, _byteVar_\n\n**Get Current File Position**\n\nThe `NOTE` statement retrieves the current file position for random-access file operations.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```basic\nNOTE #iochn, sectVar, byteVar\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Gets current logical file position (sector + byte offset)\n- Stores 16-bit sector number (0-65535) into _sectVar_\n- Stores 8-bit byte offset (0-255) into _byteVar_\n- Automatically preserves AUX1 mode from when file was opened\n- Essential for building indexes for random-access file operations\n- Works with disk files (`D:`) and other devices supporting random access\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nOPEN #1, 8, 0, \"D:USERS.DAT\"\nNOTE #1, SEC, BYT  ' Save position before writing\nPRINT #1, \"Record data\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### POINT #_iochn_, _sectExpr_, _byteExpr_\n\n**Set File Position**\n\nThe `POINT` statement sets the file position for random-access file operations.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```basic\nPOINT #iochn, sectExpr, byteExpr\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Sets file position to specified sector and byte offset\n- Enables indexed/random-access reads by jumping to previously saved positions\n- Automatically preserves AUX1 mode from when file was opened\n- Works with disk files (`D:`) and other devices supporting random access\n- Used together with `NOTE` for building indexed file systems\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nOPEN #1, 4, 0, \"D:USERS.DAT\"\nPOINT #1, SEC, BYT  ' Jump to saved position\nINPUT #1, A$\n```\n\n---\n\n### INCLUDE \"_filename_\"\n\n**Include Source Files**\n\nThe `INCLUDE` directive allows modular code organization by including other source files at compile time.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```basic\nINCLUDE \"filename\"\nINCLUDE ONCE \"filename\"\n#include \"filename\"  ' C-style syntax also supported\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Inserts contents of another source file at compile time\n- Supports `INCLUDE ONCE` to prevent multiple inclusions\n- Automatic `.bas` extension if no extension specified\n- Path resolution: current file directory → include search paths → working directory\n- Cross-platform path support (both `/` and `\\` separators)\n- Circular include detection (max 32 levels)\n- Only works with command-line compiler, not IDE interpreter\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nINCLUDE \"lib/math.bas\"\nINCLUDE \"lib/graphics.bas\"\n\nFUNC main\n  ? add(5, 3)\nENDFUNC\n\n@main\n```\n\n---\n\n## New Functions\n\n### DVSTAT(_index_)\n\n**Read DVSTAT Buffer**\n\nThe `DVSTAT()` function provides easy access to the device status buffer (memory locations 746-749).\n\n**Syntax:**\n```basic\nDVSTAT(index)  ' index: 0, 1, 2, or 3\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Reads a byte from the DVSTAT buffer\n- _index_ must be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (corresponding to DVSTAT[0] through DVSTAT[3])\n- Used after `STATUS` statement to read device-specific information\n- Meaning of each byte depends on device handler:\n  - `DVSTAT(0)` - Error bits (bitfield)\n  - `DVSTAT(1)` - Sense byte or buffer count low byte\n  - `DVSTAT(2)` - Buffer count high byte (usually 0)\n  - `DVSTAT(3)` - Output buffer count\n- Particularly useful with R: devices for checking carrier status, error bits, and buffer counts\n\n**Example:**\n```basic\nSTATUS #1, ST\nIF ST = 1 THEN\n  ERR_BITS = DVSTAT(0)\n  SENSE = DVSTAT(1)\n  INPUT_COUNT = DVSTAT(1) + 256 * DVSTAT(2)\n  OUTPUT_COUNT = DVSTAT(3)\nENDIF\n```\n\n---\n\n## Functional Enhancements\n\n### Random-Access File Operations\n\nFORGE adds native support for random-access file operations through `NOTE` and `POINT` statements:\n\n- **Automatic AUX1 preservation** - No need to manually track and pass AUX1 values\n- **Safer than XIO** - Built-in error handling and proper mode management\n- **Indexed file support** - Enables building databases, message bases, and indexed record systems\n- **Simplified syntax** - No need to remember XIO command codes (37/38)\n\n### Modular Code Organization\n\nFORGE adds `INCLUDE` directives for better code organization:\n\n- **Multi-file projects** - Split large programs into logical modules\n- **Code reuse** - Build libraries of reusable procedures and functions\n- **Better organization** - Separate concerns into different files\n- **Include guards** - `INCLUDE ONCE` prevents duplicate inclusions\n\n### Unified Function/Procedure Syntax\n\nFORGE uses `FUNC`/`ENDFUNC` for both procedures and functions:\n\n- **Unified syntax** - One keyword for both procedures and functions\n- **Return values** - Functions with `RETURN` can be used in expressions\n- **Automatic return handling** - `ENDFUNC` automatically emits the correct return token\n- **Cleaner code** - More natural expression of mathematical and logical operations\n\n### Device Status Queries\n\nFORGE adds `STATUS` statement and `DVSTAT()` function:\n\n- **Standardized status checking** - Consistent way to query device status\n- **R: device support** - Essential for serial device operations (Atari 850, modems)\n- **Error detection** - Easy access to device error bits and status information\n- **Buffer management** - Check input/output buffer counts for concurrent mode\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nFORGE provides the following key functional capabilities:\n\n1. **FUNC/ENDFUNC** - Unified syntax for procedures and functions (replaces PROC/ENDPROC)\n2. **STATUS** - Device status querying statement\n3. **NOTE** - Get current file position for random-access files\n4. **POINT** - Set file position for random-access files\n5. **INCLUDE** - Source file inclusion for modular code organization\n6. **DVSTAT()** - Function to read device status buffer\n\nThese additions enable:\n- Better code organization (INCLUDE)\n- Unified function/procedure syntax (FUNC replaces PROC)\n- Native random-access file operations (NOTE/POINT)\n- Easier device status checking (STATUS/DVSTAT)\n\n**Note:** FORGE uses `FUNC`/`ENDFUNC` for both procedures and functions. If you're migrating code that uses `PROC`/`ENDPROC`, update it to use `FUNC`/`ENDFUNC` instead.\n"},"currentPath":"getting-started/differences"},"__N_SSG":true}
