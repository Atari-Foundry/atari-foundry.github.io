Editor Guide\n\nComplete reference for the FORGE integrated editor.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe FORGE IDE includes a full-screen editor for writing and editing BASIC programs. All editor commands use the `CONTROL` key in combination with another key.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference\n\n| Shortcut | Command | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| `Ctrl-A` | Move to beginning | Moves cursor to the beginning of the current line |\n| `Ctrl-E` | Move to end | Moves cursor to the end of the current line |\n| `Ctrl-U` | Page up | Moves cursor 19 lines up |\n| `Ctrl-I` | Page down | Moves cursor 19 lines down |\n| `Ctrl-Z` | Undo | Reverts all editing of the current line |\n| `Ctrl-C` | Set Mark | Sets the current line as source for copy operation |\n| `Ctrl-V` | Paste | Copies line from marked position to current cursor position |\n| `Ctrl-Q` | Quit | Returns to DOS, abandoning changes |\n| `Ctrl-S` | Save | Saves the current file to disk |\n| `Ctrl-L` | Load | Loads a file from disk |\n| `Ctrl-N` | New file | Starts editing a new file |\n| `Ctrl-R` | Run | Parses and runs the current program |\n| `Ctrl-W` | Compile | Compiles the program to a binary file |\n| `Ctrl-G` | Go to line | Moves cursor to a specific line number |\n\n## Navigation Commands\n\n### Line Navigation\n\n- **`CONTROL-A`** and **`CONTROL-E`**: Moves the cursor to the beginning or the end of the line respectively.\n\n### Page Navigation\n\n- **`CONTROL-U`** and **`CONTROL-I`**: Moves the cursor 19 lines up or down respectively. This provides quick page-by-page navigation through your program.\n\n### Go to Line\n\n- **`CONTROL-G`**: Moves the cursor to a specific line. The editor will prompt you for the line number.\n\n## Editing Commands\n\n### Undo\n\n- **`CONTROL-Z`**: Reverts all editing of the current line. Note that changing the line clears the undo buffer, so you can't undo more than one line.\n\n### Copy and Paste\n\n- **`CONTROL-C`**: Sets the current line as the source for a copy operation.\n- **`CONTROL-V`**: Copies one line from the source marked with `CONTROL-C` to the current cursor position. After the copy, the source line is advanced, so by pressing `CONTROL-V` multiple times you can copy multiple consecutive lines.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n1. Move to the line you want to copy\n2. Press `CONTROL-C` to mark it\n3. Move to where you want to paste\n4. Press `CONTROL-V` to paste (repeat to paste multiple lines)\n\n## File Operations\n\n### New File\n\n- **`CONTROL-N`**: Starts editing a new file. If the current file has unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save.\n\n### Load File\n\n- **`CONTROL-L`**: Loads a file from disk. You'll be prompted for the filename.\n\n### Save File\n\n- **`CONTROL-S`**: Saves the file being edited. You'll be prompted for the filename if it's a new file.\n\n**Tips:**\n- Press `ESC` to cancel any file operation prompt\n- Use `BACKSPACE` to edit the proposed filename\n- Save often to avoid losing work\n\n### Quit\n\n- **`CONTROL-Q`**: Returns to DOS, abandoning any changes in the current file. You'll be prompted to confirm if there are unsaved changes.\n\n## Program Execution\n\n### Run Program\n\n- **`CONTROL-R`**: Parses the current program and runs it. If there are syntax errors, the cursor will move to the error location.\n\n### Compile Program\n\n- **`CONTROL-W`**: Compiles the current program and saves it to a binary file. You'll be prompted for the output filename.\n\nSee [Compiling](../getting-started/compiling.md) for more details on compilation.\n\n## Cursor Movement\n\nIn addition to the `CONTROL` key combinations, you can use:\n\n- **Cursor keys**: `CONTROL` and `-`, `=`, `+` or `*` to move the cursor\n- **BACKSPACE**: Delete character before cursor\n- **DELETE**: Delete character at cursor (or `CONTROL` + `BACKSPACE`)\n- **RETURN**: Move to next line\n- **DELETE at end of line**: Join two lines together\n\n## Workflow Tips\n\n### Efficient Editing\n\n1. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - They're much faster than menu navigation\n2. **Learn the abbreviations** - Many FORGE statements can be abbreviated\n3. **Use copy/paste** - For repetitive code patterns\n4. **Save frequently** - Use `CONTROL-S` often\n\n### Code Organization\n\n1. **Use comments** - Start lines with `'` or `.` for comments\n2. **Indent logically** - While not required, indentation improves readability\n3. **Group related code** - Keep related statements together\n\n### Debugging\n\n1. **Use `CONTROL-R`** - Run frequently to catch errors early\n2. **Check error location** - Cursor automatically moves to syntax errors\n3. **Use `CONTROL-G`** - Jump to specific line numbers when debugging\n\n## Editor Features\n\n### Line Numbers\n\nThe editor displays the current line number on the right side of the first line of the screen.\n\n### Empty Lines\n\nLines that show an arrow pointing to the top-left are empty lines beyond the last line of the current file.\n\n### File Name Display\n\nThe name of the currently edited file is shown on the first line of the screen.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- **Undo is limited** - Only the current line can be undone\n- **No multi-line selection** - Copy/paste works one line at a time\n- **No search/replace** - Manual editing required\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Editor Optimization](editor-optimization.md) - Performance tips\n- [Language Reference](../language-reference/syntax.md) - Learn FORGE syntax\n- [First Steps](../getting-started/first-steps.md) - Write your first program\n"},"currentPath":"editor/editor-guide"},"__N_SSG":true}
