First Steps\n\nThis guide will help you write and run your first FORGE program.\n\n## Starting FORGE\n\nTo run FORGE from the included disk image, simply type `FORGE` at the DOS prompt. This will load the IDE and present you with a help screen:\n\n```\n--D:HELP.TXT-------------------0--\n'  FORGE %VERSION% - (c) 2026 Rick Collette & AtariFoundry.com\n'\n' Editor Help\n' -----------\n'  Ctrl-A : Move to beginning of line\n'  Ctrl-E : Move to end of line\n'  Ctrl-U / Ctrl-I : Page up / down\n'  Ctrl-Z : Undo (only current line)\n'  Ctrl-C : Set Mark to current line\n'  Ctrl-V : Paste from Mark to here\n'  Ctrl-Q : Exit to DOS\n'  Ctrl-S : Save file\n'  Ctrl-L : Load file\n'  Ctrl-N : New file\n'  Ctrl-R : Parse and run program\n'  Ctrl-W : Compile to binary file\n'  Ctrl-G : Go to line number\n'\n'- Press CONTROL-N to begin -\n```\n\n## The Editor Interface\n\nYou are now in the integrated editor. On the first line of the screen the name of the currently edited file is shown, and at the right the line on which the cursor is located.\n\n**Note:** Lines that show an arrow pointing to the top-left are empty lines beyond the last line of the current file.\n\nIn this example, the cursor is in the first column of the first line of the file being edited.\n\n## Creating a New File\n\nPress `CONTROL` and `N` (at the same time) to begin editing a new file. If the text was changed, the editor asks if you want to save the current file to disk:\n\n- To skip saving, type `CONTROL-C`\n- To cancel the New File command, type `ESC`\n\n## Your First Program\n\nNow you are ready to start writing your own BASIC program. Try the following example, pressing `RETURN` after each line to advance to the next:\n\n```basic\nINPUT \"WHAT IS YOUR NAME?\";NAME$\n?\n? \"HELLO\", NAME$\n```\n\n## Making Corrections\n\nThe parser will let you know if you made any mistakes. To make corrections:\n\n- Move back using the cursor keys: `CONTROL` and `-`, `=`, `+` or `*`\n- Press `BACKSPACE` to delete the character before the cursor\n- Press `DELETE` (`CONTROL` and `BACKSPACE`) to delete the character below the cursor\n- To join two lines, go to the end of the first line and press `DELETE`\n\n## Running Your Program\n\nAfter typing the last line, you can run the program by pressing `CONTROL` and `R`.\n\nIf there are no errors with your program, it will run now: the computer screen will show `WHAT IS YOUR NAME?`, type anything and press `RETURN`, the computer will reply with a greeting and the program will end.\n\nAfter this, the IDE waits for any key press before returning to the editor, so you have a chance to see your program's output.\n\n## Interrupting Programs\n\nIf you press the `BREAK` key when the program is running, it will terminate, wait for a key press and return to the IDE.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf you made a mistake typing in the program code, instead of the program running, the cursor will move to the line and column of the error so you can correct it and retry.\n\n## Saving Your Work\n\nRemember to save often by pressing `CONTROL` and `S` keys and entering a filename. Type the name and press `ENTER` to save. As with any prompt, you can press `ESC` to cancel the save operation. Use the `BACKSPACE` over the proposed file name if you want to change it.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### Syntax Errors\n\n- Missing quotes around strings\n- Forgetting to end statements properly\n- Using incorrect variable names\n\n### Logic Errors\n\n- Variables not initialized before use\n- Array bounds not checked\n- Type mismatches (integer vs floating point)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Program won't run:**\n- Check for syntax errors (cursor will point to the error)\n- Ensure all variables are properly declared\n- Verify all statements are spelled correctly\n\n**Can't see output:**\n- Program may be waiting for input\n- Check if program completed successfully\n- Press any key to return to editor\n\n**Editor seems slow:**\n- See [Editor Optimization](../editor/editor-optimization.md) for performance tips\n- Use EFAST screen accelerator\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Compiling](compiling.md) - Compile your program to an executable\n- [Editor Guide](../editor/editor-guide.md) - Learn more editor features\n- [Language Reference](../language-reference/syntax.md) - Learn FORGE syntax\n"},"currentPath":"getting-started/first-steps"},"__N_SSG":true}
