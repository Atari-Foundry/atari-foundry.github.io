<p>This project stands on the shoulders of some seriously impressive work. Let&#x27;s give credit where credit is due, because without the foundation, we&#x27;d just be standing here with a pile of bits and no idea what to do with them.</p>
<h2>The Original Architect: Daniel Serpell</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Serpell</strong> - The brilliant mind behind the original mkatr and lsatr tools. This is the person who looked at Atari disk images and said &quot;I can make tools for that&quot; - and then actually did it. And did it well.</p>
<h3>What This Amazing Human Built</h3>
<p>Daniel created the entire foundation that atrforge is built on. We&#x27;re talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The core ATR image creation and extraction engine</strong> - The thing that actually makes disk images work. This isn&#x27;t trivial. Disk formats are weird, and getting them right takes serious skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-format DOS support</strong> - The ability to read from SpartaDOS, Atari DOS, MyDOS, LiteDOS, and more. Each of these formats is different, with its own quirks and peculiarities. Supporting them all? That&#x27;s the work of someone who really knows their stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The filesystem implementations</strong> - Understanding how these old filesystems work, parsing their structures, extracting files correctly. This is the kind of work that makes you appreciate how clever people can be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The entire tool architecture</strong> - A clean, well-designed codebase that&#x27;s actually maintainable. In 2026, we&#x27;re still building on code that was written years ago, and it&#x27;s still solid. That&#x27;s quality engineering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, without Daniel&#x27;s work, atrforge wouldn&#x27;t exist. We&#x27;d be starting from scratch, and that would be... well, let&#x27;s just say we&#x27;re glad we didn&#x27;t have to do that. The original mkatr tools were already excellent - we just added some modern touches and security improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Daniel, for building something awesome that we could build upon.</strong></p>
<h2>What We Added (2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Rick Collette &amp; AtariFoundry.com</strong> - We came along and said &quot;this is great, but what if we made it even better?&quot; So we did some things:</p>
<h3>Security Improvements</h3>
<p>Because security matters, even for 8-bit disk images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path traversal prevention (because <code>../</code> shouldn&#x27;t escape directories)</li>
<li>Input validation and sanitization (trust but verify, you know?)</li>
<li>Integer overflow protection (math is hard, but we try)</li>
<li>Sector number validation (boundaries are important)</li>
<li>Memory safety improvements (because crashes are no fun)</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<p>Because more features are more betterer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ATR file modification</strong> - Add files to existing images without recreating everything</li>
<li><strong>ATR conversion tool</strong> - Resize and convert between formats</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced CLI options</strong> - Quiet mode, force overwrite, verification</li>
<li><strong>UTF8/ATASCII conversion</strong> - Because modern editors are picky</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong> - Because good tools deserve good docs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Quality</h3>
<p>Because clean code is happy code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better error handling (errors happen, but we handle them gracefully)</li>
<li>Improved consistency (because consistency is the hobgoblin of... actually, it&#x27;s just good practice)</li>
<li>Documentation updates (we wrote a lot of words about this stuff)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Daniel Serpell built something excellent. We took that excellent foundation and added modern security practices, new features, and a whole lot of documentation. The result is atrforge - a toolkit that honors the original work while bringing it into the modern era.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re proud to build on such a solid foundation. Thanks for making our job easier, Daniel!</p>

<h3>Files Enhanced by Rick Collette &amp; AtariFoundry.com</h3>
<p>We improved many of Daniel&#x27;s original files with security fixes, validation, and new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/compat.c</code> / <code>src/compat.h</code> - Path sanitization</li>
<li><code>src/lssfs.c</code> / <code>src/lsdos.c</code> / <code>src/lsextra.c</code> - Security and validation improvements</li>
<li><code>src/spartafs.c</code> / <code>src/atr.c</code> / <code>src/mkatr.c</code> - Safety and error handling enhancements</li>
<li><code>src/lsatr.c</code> - New CLI options</li>
<li><code>src/flist.c</code> - String safety improvements</li>
<li>Various header files - Updated function signatures</li>
<li><code>README.md</code> - Enhanced with new information</li>
</ul>
<p>The original code structure and design philosophy remain intact - we just made it safer and added some modern conveniences.</p>
